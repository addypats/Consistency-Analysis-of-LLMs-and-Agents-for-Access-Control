# Policy: Subscriber-chosen memorized secrets SHALL be at least 8 characters in length.
minlen = 8
#
# Policy: Memorized secrets chosen randomly by the CSP or verifier shall be at least 6 characters.
# Note: This file enforces subscriber-chosen secret requirements.
#
# Policy: No additional complexity requirements SHOULD be imposed.
# (No composition rules—such as requiring mixtures of character types—are set.)
#
# Policy: The verifier SHALL check the chosen secret against a blacklist of compromised values.
dictcheck = 1

# Policy: Verifiers SHOULD permit subscriber-chosen secrets up to 64 characters in length.
# Note: Maximum length enforcement is typically managed by the application.
#
# Additional policies (not enforceable via pwdquality.conf):
# - All printing ASCII and Unicode characters are acceptable.
# - Normalization (e.g., NFKC/NFKD) and handling of consecutive spaces should be managed by the system.
# - No password hints shall be stored or provided.
# - Rate limiting on failed authentication attempts must be implemented externally.
