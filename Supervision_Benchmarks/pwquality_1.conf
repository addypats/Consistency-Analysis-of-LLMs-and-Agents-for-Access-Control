# Generated pwdquality.conf based on provided password policies.
#
# Policy: Passwords must be at least eight characters in length.
minlen = 8
# Note: It is recommended to use passwords of at least 15 characters.
#
# Policy: Authenticators should monitor newly registered passwords for obvious security weaknesses,
# such as sequential number strings and common words like "password".
# (Implement monitoring of new passwords in the authentication system.)
#
# Policy: Authenticators should screen new passwords against lists of previously compromised passwords
# and reject those that have already been breached.
# (Integration with a compromised password database is required.)
#
# Policy: Organizations should not use password hints.
# (Ensure that password hints are disabled in user account settings.)
#
# Policy: Composition rules for including special characters are no longer required,
# as these may lead to predictable passwords.
# (No explicit composition checks are enforced here.)
#
# Policy: Long passwords are encouraged over complex ones.
# NIST recommends enabling passphrases of up to 64 characters.
#
# Policy: Password-based authentication should be enhanced with multi-factor authentication,
# and risk-based authentication techniques should be used whenever possible.
# (These enhancements must be implemented at the authentication system level.)
