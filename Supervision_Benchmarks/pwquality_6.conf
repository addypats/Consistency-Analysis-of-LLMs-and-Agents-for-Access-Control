# Generated pwdquality.conf based on provided password policies (7th set).
#
# Policy: Use MFA wherever possible.
# (MFA enforcement must be handled by the authentication system.)
#
# Policy: For password-only accounts, require a minimum length of 14 characters;
# for MFA-enabled accounts, 8 characters are acceptable.
# This configuration enforces a minimum length of 14 characters.
minlen = 14
#
# Policy: Maximum password length should be as long as possible and should not be limited.
# (No maximum length is set in this configuration.)
#
# Policy: Allow all character types and require at least one non-alphabetic character for password-only accounts.
# Due to configuration limitations, this file enforces the presence of at least one digit (a non-alphabetic character).
dcredit = -1
#
# Policy: Change the password immediately in the event of a breach, with an annual expiration as a backstop.
# (This must be enforced through account management policies, not via pwdquality.conf.)
#
# Policy: Check new passwords against an internal deny list of known bad or weak passwords (minimum 20 common passwords)
# and the previous 5 passwords.
# (The dictionary check is enabled here, but enforcing a history check is beyond pwdquality.confâ€™s scope.)
dictcheck = 1
#
# Policy: Enforce a password change delay of at least one day.
# (This delay must be managed outside of pwdquality.conf.)
#
# Policy: Lock the current session after 15 minutes (or less) of inactivity.
# (Session timeout settings must be configured at the system level.)
#
# Policy: Implement a temporary account lockout (15 minutes or more) after five consecutive failed attempts,
# with time-doubling throttling and permanent account lockout after 12 retries.
# (Account lockout and throttling must be enforced by the authentication system.)
#
# Policy: Monitor and alert key personnel when the bad login attempts reach the limit.
# (This monitoring must be implemented externally.)
#
# Policy: Automatically suspend the account after 45 days without a valid login.
# (Account suspension is managed by system administration tools.)
#
# Policy: Do not allow user-defined password "hints" at login.
# (Password hint policies must be enforced by the authentication interface.)
