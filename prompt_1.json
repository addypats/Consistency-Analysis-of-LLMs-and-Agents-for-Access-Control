"Passwords must be at least eight characters in length and should be at least 15 characters in length.\nAuthenticators should monitor newly registered passwords for obvious security weaknesses, like sequential number strings and common words like “password”.\nAuthenticators should screen new passwords against lists of previously compromised passwords and reject those that have already been breached.\nOrganizations should not use password hints, since these can provide hackers important clues.\nComposition rules for including special characters are no longer required, since these often lead to predictable passwords.\nLong passwords are encouraged over complex ones. NIST recommends enabling passphrases of up to 64 characters.\nPassword-based authentication should be enhanced with multi-factor authentication, and risk-based authentication techniques should be used whenever possible."
