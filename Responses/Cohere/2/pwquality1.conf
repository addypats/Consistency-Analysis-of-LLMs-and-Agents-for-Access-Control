# Note: The following rules are recommendations and cannot be enforced directly via pwquality.conf
# They should be communicated as part of the organization's password policy:
# - Passwords must not be inserted into email messages or other forms of electronic communication.
# - Passwords should not be shared with anyone, including via email or phone conversations.
# - Passwords should not be written down or stored electronically without encryption.
# - Passwords should not be based on a dictionary word, and not be part of your name or user name.
```

**Note:** The comments at the end are included to highlight that certain rules (like sharing, storage, and usage policies) cannot be enforced directly via `pwquality.conf` and should be communicated separately as part of the organization's password policy.
