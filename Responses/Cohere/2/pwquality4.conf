ocredit = -1
lcredit = -1

# Password expiration and history
maxrepeat = 3

# Password change interval (90 days)

# Prevent password reuse (equivalent to remembering 1 previous password)

# Enforce password change cooldown (2 days)

# Note: The following rules are recommendations and cannot be enforced directly via pwquality.conf
# but should be implemented through organizational policies and user training:
# - Passwords must not be shared or transmitted via email/phone.
# - Passwords should not be written down or stored unencrypted.
# - Passwords should not be based on dictionary words, names, or usernames.
