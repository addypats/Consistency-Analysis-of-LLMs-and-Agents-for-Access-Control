# Note: The following rules cannot be directly enforced via pwquality.conf
# but should be implemented through additional policies or scripts:
# - Passwords must not be inserted into email messages or shared.
# - Passwords should not be written down or stored electronically without encryption.
# - Passwords should not be based on dictionary words or part of the user's name/username.
```

**Note:** The rules regarding email, sharing, writing down, and dictionary-based passwords cannot be enforced directly via `pwquality.conf` and require additional organizational policies or scripts for enforcement.
