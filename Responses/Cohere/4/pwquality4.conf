```plaintext
# /etc/security/pwquality.conf

# Minimum password length for user-chosen passwords
minlen = 8

# Maximum password length (allow up to 64 characters)
maxclassrepeat = 64

# Allow all printing ASCII and Unicode characters
lcredit = 0
ucredit = 0
dcredit = 0
ocredit = 0

# Do not enforce specific character types
minclass = 0

# Do not enforce character repetition restrictions
maxrepeat = 0

# Do not truncate passwords
dictcheck = 1

# Enable blacklist checking (custom blacklist can be configured separately)
cracklibdict = /path/to/blacklist

# Rate limiting for failed authentication attempts (configure in PAM or system-specific settings)
# Note: Rate limiting is typically configured in PAM or system-specific security modules, not in pwquality.conf

# Allow spaces and handle multiple consecutive spaces as a single space
# (This is handled at the application level as per the policy)

# No arbitrary password expiration
# (Password expiration policies are typically managed in PAM or system-specific settings)
```

**Notes:**
- The `cracklibdict` path should point to a custom blacklist file containing compromised, common, or weak passwords.
- Rate limiting and password expiration policies are typically enforced via PAM (`/etc/pam.d/` files) or system-specific security modules, not directly in `pwquality.conf`.
- Unicode normalization (NFKC/NFKD) and space handling must be implemented at the application or verification layer, as `pwquality.conf` does not directly support these features.
