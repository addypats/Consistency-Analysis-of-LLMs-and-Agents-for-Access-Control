# /etc/security/pwquality.conf

# Minimum password length for user-chosen passwords
minlen = 8

# Maximum password length (allow up to 64 characters)
maxclassrepeat = 64

# Allow all printing ASCII and Unicode characters
lcredit = 0
ucredit = 0
dcredit = 0
ocredit = 0

# Do not enforce composition rules (e.g., mixtures of character types)
minclass = 0

# Do not truncate passwords
notruncate

# Replace multiple consecutive spaces with a single space
dictcheck = /path/to/blacklist.dict

# Rate limiting for failed attempts (configure in PAM or system-specific settings)
# Note: Rate limiting is typically handled in PAM configuration, not pwquality.conf

# Allow Unicode characters (normalization is handled at the application level)
# No specific pwquality.conf option for Unicode normalization

# No hints or specific prompts for password choice
# This is handled at the application or policy level, not in pwquality.conf

# Force password change on evidence of compromise
# This is typically handled by system policies or monitoring tools, not pwquality.conf
```

**Notes:**
- Replace `/path/to/blacklist.dict` with the actual path to your blacklist dictionary file.
- Rate limiting and Unicode normalization are not directly configurable in `pwquality.conf` and should be implemented at the application or system level (e.g., PAM configuration or custom scripts).
- Password strength meters and guidance are application-specific and not controlled by `pwquality.conf`.
