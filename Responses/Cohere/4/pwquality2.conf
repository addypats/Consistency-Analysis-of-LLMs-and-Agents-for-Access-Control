# Enforce blacklist checks (handled externally by PAM modules or scripts)
# Note: Blacklist enforcement is typically done via pam_pwquality.so or custom scripts

# Allow Unicode characters (normalization is handled at the application level)
# No specific configuration here, as it depends on the application's implementation

# No password hints or specific prompts
# This is typically enforced at the application or policy level, not in pwquality.conf
