```plaintext
# /etc/security/pwquality.conf

# Minimum password length for user-chosen passwords
minlen = 8

# Maximum password length (allow up to 64 characters)
maxclassrepeat = 64

# Allow all printing ASCII characters and spaces
lcredit = 0
ucredit = 0
dcredit = 0
ocredit = 0

# Do not enforce specific character types (e.g., uppercase, lowercase, digits, special chars)
minclass = 0

# Do not truncate passwords
notruncate

# Allow Unicode characters (Note: This requires system-level support for Unicode in passwords)
# No specific option in pwquality.conf for Unicode, but ensure the system supports it

# Rate limiting is typically handled at the application or service level, not directly in pwquality.conf

# Blacklist enforcement is typically handled by external tools or libraries (e.g., libcrack2)
# pwquality.conf does not directly support blacklists, but you can integrate with tools like pam_cracklib.so

# No arbitrary password expiration (handled by PAM or system policies)

# Allow spaces, but replace multiple consecutive spaces with a single space (if supported by the PAM module)
# Note: This behavior is not directly configurable in pwquality.conf and may require custom PAM modules
```

**Note:** Some requirements (e.g., Unicode normalization, blacklist enforcement, rate limiting, and space handling) are not directly configurable in `pwquality.conf` and may require additional system configurations, PAM modules, or custom scripts.
