# /etc/security/pwquality.conf

# Minimum password length for password-only accounts
minlen = 14

# Minimum password length for MFA-enabled accounts
# Note: This requires additional configuration outside of pwquality.conf
# For demonstration, assuming MFA accounts are handled separately

# Maximum password length (unlimited)
maxclassrepeat = 0

# Allow all character types and require at least one non-alphabetic character for password-only accounts
dcredit = -1

# Password expiration and breach response
# Note: Annual expiration and immediate change on breach require additional PAM module configuration

# Password history and deny list
retry = 3
difok = 5

# Enforce password change delay of at least one day
# Note: This requires additional PAM module configuration

# Session inactivity timeout (15 minutes)
# Note: This is typically configured in /etc/profile or similar

# Temporary account lockout after 5 failed attempts
fail_retry = 5

# Time doubling throttling and permanent lockout after 12 retries
# Note: This requires additional PAM module configuration with pam_faillock or similar

# Account suspension after 45 days of inactivity
# Note: This requires additional cron job or monitoring script

# Disable user-defined password hints
# Note: This is typically handled by the authentication system, not pwquality.conf

# Additional notes:
# - MFA enforcement requires integration with MFA systems.
# - Monitoring and alerting require external logging and alerting systems.
# - Some policies (e.g., session timeout, password change delay) require PAM or system-specific configurations.
```

**Note:** This file primarily addresses password complexity and history via `pwquality.conf`. Other policies (e.g., MFA, session timeout, account lockout, monitoring) require additional configurations in PAM modules (`/etc/pam.d/*`), system scripts, or external tools. Adjust accordingly based on your Linux distribution and environment.
