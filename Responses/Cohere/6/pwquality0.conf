**Notes:**
- Some policies (e.g., MFA differentiation, password expiration, session lockout, permanent account lockout, and account suspension) cannot be fully enforced via `pwquality.conf` alone and require additional PAM modules, scripts, or system configurations.
- Ensure PAM modules like `pam_faillock`, `pam_tally2`, and `pam_pwquality` are properly configured to enforce the remaining policies.
- MFA enforcement should be handled at the authentication layer (e.g., SSH, web applications) or via PAM modules like `pam_u2f`.
