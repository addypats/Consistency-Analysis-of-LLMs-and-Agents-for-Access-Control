# /etc/security/pwquality.conf

# Minimum password length for password-only accounts
minlen = 14

# Minimum password length for MFA-enabled accounts
# Note: This requires additional configuration outside of pwquality.conf
# For MFA-enabled accounts, minlen can be set to 8 in a conditional policy.

# Maximum password length (unlimited)
maxclassrepeat = 0

# Allow all character types and require at least one non-alphabetic character for password-only accounts
minclass = 3

# Password expiration and breach response
# Note: Annual expiration and breach response require additional configuration in /etc/login.defs or PAM modules.

# Password history and deny list
# Note: Deny list and password history checks require additional configuration with PAM modules like pam_pwquality.so.
retry = 3
difok = 5

# Password change delay (1 day)
mindaybetweenchg = 1

# Session inactivity timeout (15 minutes)
# Note: This is typically configured in /etc/profile or PAM session modules.

# Temporary account lockout after 5 failed attempts
fail_retry = 5

# Time doubling throttling and permanent lockout after 12 retries
# Note: This requires additional configuration with PAM modules like pam_faillock.so.

# Account suspension after 45 days of inactivity
# Note: This requires additional configuration with cron jobs or monitoring tools.

# Disable user-defined password hints
# Note: This is typically configured in the authentication system or application.

# Additional PAM configuration notes:
# - Use pam_faillock.so for fail retry, lockout, and throttling.
# - Use pam_pwquality.so for password complexity and history checks.
# - Use pam_tally2.so or pam_faillock.so for monitoring and alerting.

**Note:** Some of the policies (e.g., MFA integration, session timeout, account suspension, and monitoring) require additional configuration outside of `pwquality.conf`, such as PAM modules, system scripts, or application settings. Adjust the configuration accordingly based on your system and environment.
