**Note:** The `dictcheck`, `usercheck`, and `gecoscheck` options, along with the `cracklib` library, help enforce the rules against dictionary words, username, and personal information. However, please be aware that the specific implementation and availability of these features may vary depending on the Linux distribution and version of the `pwquality` library.
