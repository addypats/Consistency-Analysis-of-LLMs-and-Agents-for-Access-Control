```
# Password expiration
minlen = 10
dcredit = -1
ucredit = -1
ocredit = -1
lcredit = -1
minclass = 3

# Password change interval (90 days)
maxage = 90

# Password reuse prevention (1 year)
remember = 365

# Prevent dictionary words and common patterns
dictcheck = 1

# Prevent use of username, social security number, etc.
username_check = 1
gecos_check = 1
```

**Note:** The `pwquality.conf` file does not directly support checking for social security numbers, nicknames, relative's names, or birth dates. These checks would typically be implemented in a custom password validation script or plugin. The `username_check` and `gecos_check` options are included as a basic measure to prevent obvious ties to the account owner.

Additionally, the `dictcheck` option helps prevent dictionary words and common patterns, but it may not catch all acronyms or specific personal information. A more comprehensive solution would require a custom validation script or integration with a third-party password policy enforcement tool.
