```
# Password must be changed every 90 days
minlen = 10

# Password must contain a combination of alpha, numeric, and special characters
dcredit = -1
ucredit = -1
ocredit = -1
lcredit = -1

# Password must not be easily tied back to the account owner (enforced by pam_cracklib or similar module)
# Note: This requires additional configuration in PAM to enforce dictionary checks and user-specific checks

# Password must not be dictionary words or acronyms (enforced by pam_cracklib or similar module)
dictcheck = 1

# Password cannot be reused for 1 year (365 days)
remember = 365

# Enforce the above rules
minclass = 3
```

**Note:** To fully enforce the rules regarding dictionary words, acronyms, and user-specific information, you would need to configure additional PAM modules like `pam_cracklib` or `pam_pwquality` with specific options in `/etc/pam.d/common-password`. This configuration file only sets the basic password complexity and reuse policies.
