Here is a sample /etc/security/pwquality.conf file with the requested password policy rules:

 ``` # Password policy rules
 ``` # Passwords must be at least 8 characters in length and should be at least 15 characters in length.
 ``` # Authenticators should monitor newly registered passwords for obvious security weaknesses, like sequential number strings and common words like "password".
 ``` # Authenticators should screen new passwords against lists of previously compromised passwords and reject those that have already been breached.
 ``` # Organizations should not use password hints, since these can provide hackers important clues.
 ``` # Composition rules for including special characters are no longer required, since these often lead to predictable passwords.
 ``` # Long passwords are encouraged over complex ones. Passphrases of up to 64 characters are recommended.
 ``` # Password-based authentication should be enhanced with multi-factor authentication, and risk-based authentication techniques should be used whenever possible.
