**Note:** The `cracklib` directive is not a standard option in `pwquality.conf`. To implement checking against compromised passwords, you would typically use a custom script or integrate with a service that provides such functionality. The path provided is a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual path to your compromised password list or script.
