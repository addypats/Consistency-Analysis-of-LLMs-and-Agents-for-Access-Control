**Note:** The file above enforces the password policy rules as closely as possible using `pwquality.conf`. However, multi-factor authentication (MFA) and risk-based authentication cannot be configured directly in this file, as they require additional system or application-level configurations. The `cracklib_dict` path should be updated to point to an actual compromised password list.
