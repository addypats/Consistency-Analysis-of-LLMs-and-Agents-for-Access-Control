```plaintext
# /etc/security/pwquality.conf

# Minimum password length for user-chosen passwords
minlen = 8

# Maximum password length (allow up to 64 characters)
maxclassrepeat = 64

# Allow all printing ASCII characters and spaces
lcredit = 0
ucredit = 0
dcredit = 0
ocredit = 0

# Do not enforce specific character types
minclass = 0

# Allow Unicode characters (Note: This is a general setting, specific Unicode handling may require additional system configuration)
# No direct configuration for Unicode normalization in pwquality.conf, this may require custom scripts or integration with PAM modules

# Prevent the use of common or compromised passwords (this requires a dictionary file)
dictcheck = 1

# Example dictionary path (adjust as needed)
dictpath = /usr/share/dict/words

# Rate limiting is typically handled by PAM modules like pam_faillock or pam_tally2, not directly by pwquality

# Do not enforce password expiration or composition rules beyond length
maxrepeat = 0

# Note: Additional configuration for rate limiting, Unicode normalization, and blacklist integration may require custom PAM modules or scripts.
```

**Note:** This configuration file adheres to the NIST guidelines as closely as possible using the capabilities of `pwquality.conf`. Some requirements, such as Unicode normalization, rate limiting, and dynamic blacklists, may require additional PAM modules or custom scripts beyond what `pwquality.conf` can directly configure.
