# /etc/security/pwquality.conf

# Minimum password length for user-chosen passwords
minlen = 8

# Maximum password length (allowing up to 64 characters as recommended)
maxclassrepeat = 64

# Allow all printing ASCII characters and space
lcredit = 0
ucredit = 0
dcredit = 0
ocredit = 0

# Do not enforce specific character types (e.g., mixtures of upper, lower, digits, special)
minclass = 0

# Do not prohibit consecutively repeated characters
maxrepeat = 0

# Do not enforce periodic password changes
maxage = 0

# Rate limiting is handled externally (e.g., via PAM or system-specific mechanisms)
# Note: This file does not directly control rate limiting; it is mentioned for completeness.

# Allow Unicode characters (though not directly configurable here, this is a system-wide setting)
# Note: Unicode normalization (NFKC/NFKD) should be handled at the application or library level.

# Blacklist enforcement is handled externally (e.g., via PAM modules or custom scripts)
# Note: This file does not directly manage blacklists; it is mentioned for completeness.

# No password hints or specific prompts
# Note: This is a policy enforcement outside the scope of pwquality.conf.
