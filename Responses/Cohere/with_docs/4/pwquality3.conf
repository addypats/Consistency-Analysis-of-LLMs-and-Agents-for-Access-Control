```plaintext
# /etc/security/pwquality.conf

# Minimum password length for user-chosen passwords
minlen = 8

# Maximum password length (allow up to 64 characters)
maxclassrepeat = 64

# Allow all printing ASCII characters and spaces
lcredit = 0
ucredit = 0
dcredit = 0
ocredit = 0

# Do not enforce specific character types (e.g., uppercase, lowercase, digits, special chars)
minclass = 0

# Do not truncate passwords
notruncate

# Allow Unicode characters (Note: This requires system-level support for Unicode)
# No specific option in pwquality.conf for Unicode, but ensure the system handles it correctly

# Rate limiting is typically handled at the application or system level, not in pwquality.conf

# Reject passwords found in compromised or commonly used lists
# This requires integration with a dictionary or blacklist, which is not directly configured here

# No arbitrary password expiration (handled by system policies or PAM modules)

# Allow spaces, but replace multiple consecutive spaces with a single space (if implemented in the verifier)
# No specific option in pwquality.conf for this; requires custom logic in the verifier

# Note: Additional measures like blacklists, password strength meters, and rate limiting
# should be implemented in the application or PAM modules, as pwquality.conf focuses on
# password composition rules.
