# Prevent password reuse (not directly configurable in pwquality.conf, typically handled by pam_unix or pam_pwdfile)
# Note: Password history and reuse policies are often managed via PAM modules like pam_unix or pam_pwdfile.

# Password change frequency (once every two days)
# Note: This is typically enforced via PAM configuration, not pwquality.conf.

# Additional policies (not directly configurable in pwquality.conf, but should be enforced via organizational policies)
# - Passwords must not be shared or stored unencrypted.
# - Passwords must not be included in electronic communications.
# - Passwords should not be based on dictionary words, personal information, or usernames.
```

**Note:** The `pwquality.conf` file primarily controls password complexity and quality. Policies like password expiration, reuse, and change frequency are typically enforced via PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) configuration files (e.g., `/etc/pam.d/common-password`) or organizational scripts. The comments above highlight where additional configuration or enforcement is needed outside of `pwquality.conf`.
