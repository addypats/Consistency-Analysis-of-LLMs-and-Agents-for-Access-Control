**Note:** The rules regarding password sharing, communication, and storage (e.g., not writing down passwords, not sharing via email/phone, and encrypting stored passwords) are policy-based and cannot be enforced directly in the `pwquality.conf` file. These should be communicated through organizational policies and training. The provided configuration focuses on enforceable technical controls.
