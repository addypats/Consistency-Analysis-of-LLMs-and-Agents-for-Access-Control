# Note: The following rules are recommendations and cannot be enforced directly via pwquality.conf
# - Passwords must not be inserted into email messages or shared electronically.
# - Passwords should not be written down or stored electronically without encryption.
# - Passwords should not be based on dictionary words or personal information.
# These rules should be enforced through organizational policies and user training.

**Note:** The rules regarding email, sharing, and storage cannot be enforced directly via `pwquality.conf` and should be implemented through organizational policies and user training. The `dictcheck` option requires a dictionary-based password checking tool like `cracklib` to be installed and configured.
