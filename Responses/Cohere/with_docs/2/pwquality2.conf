# Password complexity rules
minlen = 8
minclass = 3
dcredit = -1
ucredit = -1
ocredit = -1
lcredit = -1

# Dictionary checking
dictcheck = 1

# Password expiration
maxage = 90

# Prevent password reuse
remember = 5

# Password change interval
maxrepeat = 2

# Note: The following rules cannot be directly enforced via pwquality.conf
# and require additional policies or user education:
# - Passwords must not be inserted into email messages or shared electronically.
# - Passwords should not be written down or stored electronically without encryption.
# - Passwords should not be based on dictionary words, name, or username.
```

**Note:** The rules regarding email, storage, and password composition (beyond dictionary checks) cannot be enforced directly via `pwquality.conf` and require additional organizational policies, user training, and monitoring. The `maxrepeat` setting here ensures a password cannot be changed more than once every two days by limiting the number of consecutive changes.
