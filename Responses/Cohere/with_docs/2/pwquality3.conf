# Password Complexity Rules
minlen = 8
minclass = 3
dcredit = -1
ucredit = -1
ocredit = -1
lcredit = -1

# Password Expiration
maxage = 90

# Password Change Restrictions
maxrepeat = 2

# Dictionary Checking
dictcheck = 1

# Additional Restrictions
gecoscheck = 1
usernamecheck = 1

# Note: The following rules are recommendations and cannot be enforced directly via pwquality.conf
# - Passwords must not be shared or transmitted via email/phone.
# - Passwords should not be written down or stored unencrypted.
# - Password changes are limited to once every 2 days (enforced via PAM configuration, not pwquality.conf).
```

**Note:** The rules regarding password sharing, storage, and change frequency (every 2 days) cannot be directly enforced via `pwquality.conf`. These should be implemented through organizational policies, user education, and additional PAM module configurations (e.g., `pam_passwd_check` for change frequency).
