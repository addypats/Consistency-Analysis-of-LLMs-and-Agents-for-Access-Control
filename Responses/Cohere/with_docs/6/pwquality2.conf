**Notes:**
- Some rules (e.g., MFA integration, session lockout, throttling, alerts, and account suspension) require additional configuration outside of `pwquality.conf`, such as PAM modules, scripts, or system policies.
- This file focuses on password complexity and history, while other rules need to be implemented via PAM (`/etc/pam.d/`), system scripts, or monitoring tools.
