```

**Notes:**
- MFA enforcement, session inactivity lockout, account suspension, and password hints are not directly configurable in `pwquality.conf` and require additional system or application-level configurations.
- The deny list (`dictpath`) should include at least 20 common passwords and previous 5 passwords per user.
- Monitoring and alerting for bad login attempts require integration with logging and alerting systems (e.g., syslog, SIEM).
- Annual password expiration and immediate breach response require external scripts or policies.
