# Password expiration and breach response
# Note: Password expiration and breach response require external tools or PAM modules
# This file does not directly control expiration or breach policies

# Password history and deny list
# Note: Password history and deny list require external tools or PAM modules
# This file does not directly control history or deny lists

# Enforce a password change delay of at least one day
# Note: Password change delay requires external tools or PAM modules
# This file does not directly control password change delays

# Session inactivity timeout (15 minutes)
# Note: Session timeout is typically controlled via PAM or system settings
# This file does not directly control session timeouts

# Temporary account lockout after 5 failed attempts
fail_retry = 5

# Time doubling throttling (in minutes) between each retry
# Note: Time doubling throttling requires custom scripting or PAM modules
# This file does not directly support time doubling

# Permanent account lockout after 12 retries
# Note: Permanent lockout requires custom scripting or PAM modules
# This file does not directly support permanent lockouts

# Account suspension after 45 days of inactivity
# Note: Account suspension requires external tools or PAM modules
# This file does not directly control account suspension

# Disable user-defined password hints
# Note: Password hints are typically controlled via PAM or system settings
# This file does not directly control password hints

# Additional notes:
# - MFA integration, password expiration, breach response, deny lists, session timeouts,
#   time doubling throttling, permanent lockouts, account suspension, and password hints
#   require additional configuration beyond pwquality.conf, such as PAM modules, scripts,
#   or system-specific tools.
# - This file primarily controls password complexity and minimum length.
```

**Note:** The above configuration addresses the password complexity and minimum length requirements directly manageable via `pwquality.conf`. Other policies (e.g., MFA integration, password expiration, deny lists, session timeouts, throttling, lockouts, suspension, and hints) require additional system-level or PAM module configurations not covered in this file.
