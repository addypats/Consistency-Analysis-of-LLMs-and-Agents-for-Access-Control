# Note: Checking against deny list and previous passwords requires external tools or PAM modules

# Session inactivity timeout (15 minutes)
# Note: This is typically enforced at the application or system level, not in pwquality.conf

# Temporary account lockout after 5 failed attempts
fail_retry = 5

# Time doubling throttling and permanent lockout after 12 retries
# Note: This requires PAM modules like pam_faillock or pam_tally2

# Account suspension after 45 days of inactivity
# Note: This requires external scripting or integration with account management systems

# Disable user-defined password hints
# Note: This is typically enforced at the application or system level, not in pwquality.conf

# Additional notes:
# - MFA enforcement requires integration with MFA systems.
# - Deny list and password history checks require external tools.
# - Session inactivity, permanent lockout, and account suspension require additional configuration.

**Note:** This configuration file primarily addresses password complexity and length. Additional rules like MFA enforcement, session inactivity, account lockout, and suspension require integration with PAM modules, external scripts, or system-level policies.
