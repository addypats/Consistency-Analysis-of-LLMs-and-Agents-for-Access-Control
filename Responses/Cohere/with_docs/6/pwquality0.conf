```

**Notes:**
- Some rules (e.g., MFA enforcement, session timeout, throttling, and account suspension) require additional configuration outside of `pwquality.conf`, such as PAM modules, scripts, or system-specific settings.
- The file focuses on password composition and basic lockout policies that `pwquality.conf` can directly control.
- Ensure compatibility with your system's PAM configuration and authentication mechanisms.
