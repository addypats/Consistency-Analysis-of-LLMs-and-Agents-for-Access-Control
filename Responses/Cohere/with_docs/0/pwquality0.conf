**Note:** Some of the policies (e.g., password change interval, reuse policy, and specific dictionary checks) are typically enforced via PAM configuration or additional tools like `pam_unix.so`, `pam_pwquality.so`, or `cracklib`. The above file focuses on `pwquality.conf` settings, but you may need to update `/etc/pam.d/common-password` or similar files to fully enforce all policies.
