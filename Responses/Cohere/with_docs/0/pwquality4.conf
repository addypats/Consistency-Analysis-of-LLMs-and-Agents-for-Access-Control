# Password expiration settings
minlen = 10
dcredit = -1
ucredit = -1
ocredit = -1
lcredit = -1
minclass = 4

# Password expiration every 90 days
maxage = 90

# Password history to prevent reuse for 1 year (365 days)
remember = 365

# Prevent dictionary words and common patterns
dictcheck = 1

# Prevent passwords that are easily tied to the user
gecoscheck = 1
usercheck = 1
```

**Note:** The `pwquality.conf` file does not directly enforce rules like "passwords must not be easily tied back to the account owner" or "passwords must not be dictionary words" in a granular way. The `gecoscheck`, `usercheck`, and `dictcheck` options help mitigate these risks, but additional measures (e.g., custom scripts or external tools) may be needed for stricter enforcement. Similarly, special character requirements are enforced via `minclass = 4` and credits (`dcredit`, `ucredit`, etc.), assuming the system supports special characters.
