# Password expiration settings
minlen = 10
dcredit = -1

minclass = 3

# Password history and reuse

```

**Note:** The `pwquality.conf` file primarily controls password complexity and composition. Password expiration, history, and dictionary checks are typically enforced by other mechanisms like PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) or system-specific tools. The above configuration focuses on the rules directly supported by `pwquality.conf`. For complete enforcement of all policies, additional PAM configuration may be required.
