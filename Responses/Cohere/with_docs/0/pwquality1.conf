# Prevent dictionary words and common patterns

# Prevent use of username, etc. (custom checks typically handled by PAM modules or external scripts)
# Note: The following line is a placeholder as pwquality.conf does not directly support these checks.
# Custom checks for username, SSN, etc. should be implemented via PAM modules or scripts.
```

**Note:** The rules regarding "not easily tied back to the account owner" and "not dictionary words or acronyms" are typically enforced via PAM modules or external scripts, as `pwquality.conf` does not directly support these checks. The above configuration focuses on the rules directly supported by `pwquality.conf`.
