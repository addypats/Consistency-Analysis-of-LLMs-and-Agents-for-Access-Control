**Note:** The `pwquality.conf` file primarily controls password complexity rules during creation. The expiration (`maxage`), reuse (`remember`), and dictionary checks (`dictcheck`) are directly supported. However, enforcing rules like "not easily tied back to the account owner" or "not dictionary words/acronyms" typically requires additional tools or PAM modules (e.g., `pam_cracklib`, `pam_pwquality`, or custom scripts) for comprehensive validation. The provided configuration aligns with the policy where possible.
