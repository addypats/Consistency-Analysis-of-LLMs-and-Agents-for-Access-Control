# Password length requirements
minlen = 8
dcredit = -1

ocredit = -1
lcredit = -1

# Suggest longer passwords (15 characters)
minclass = 3

# Reject passwords with sequential characters or common patterns
dictcheck = 1

# Reject compromised passwords (requires external integration)
# Note: This requires a compromised password list and external tool integration
# compromisedcheck = 1

# Disable password hints
non_root_pwexpire_hint = 0

# Allow long passphrases up to 64 characters
maxclassrepeat = 64
maxrepeat = 64
minclass = 0

# Note: Multi-factor authentication and risk-based authentication
# are not configured in pwquality.conf but should be implemented
# at the system or application level as recommended by NIST.
```

**Note:** The `compromisedcheck` option is commented out because it requires external integration with a compromised password list and additional tools. Similarly, multi-factor and risk-based authentication are not configured here, as they are system- or application-level implementations.
