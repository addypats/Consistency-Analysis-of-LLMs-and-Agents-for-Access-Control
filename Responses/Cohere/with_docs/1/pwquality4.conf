# Reject compromised passwords (requires external tool integration)
# Note: This requires a tool like 'cracklib' or 'haveibeenpwned' API integration
# cracklib_verify = 1  # Example for cracklib integration

# Disable password hints
# Note: This is a policy enforcement outside of pwquality.conf, typically managed by PAM or system policies

# Allow passphrases up to 64 characters
maxclassrepeat = 64   # Allow repetition of character classes for longer passphrases

# Multi-factor authentication and risk-based authentication are managed via PAM and other system configurations, not pwquality.conf

**Note:** The file above enforces the NIST-recommended password policies within the scope of `pwquality.conf`. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and risk-based authentication require additional configuration in PAM (`/etc/pam.d/`) and other system tools, which are outside the scope of this file. Similarly, checking against compromised password lists typically requires external tools or APIs.
