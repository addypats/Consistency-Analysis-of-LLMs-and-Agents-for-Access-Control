```

**Additional Notes:**
- **Idle Session Timeout (15 minutes):** Configure this via PAM or system-specific settings, e.g., `/etc/pam.d/common-auth` or `/etc/profile`.
- **MFA and Authentication Methods:** Implement using PAM modules like `pam_google_authenticator` or `pam_u2f`.
- **Password Storage/Transmission Encryption:** Ensure use of protocols like TLS and secure password hashing (e.g., `SHA-512` in `/etc/login.defs`).
- **Password Hardcoding:** Enforce via scripting best practices and code reviews, not directly configurable in `pwquality.conf`.
