# Disable vendor-supplied defaults and unnecessary accounts

# Session idle timeout (handled via PAM or system settings, not pwquality.conf)
# Note: This is typically configured in /etc/pam.d/system-auth or similar

# MFA and other authentication methods are handled outside of pwquality.conf
# Note: These are procedural and system-wide configuration requirements

```

**Notes:**
- The `lockout_time` is set to 1800 seconds (30 minutes) as per the policy.
- The `fail_retry` is set to 6 attempts, but another requirement mentions 10 attempts. Since the stricter rule is typically preferred, 6 is used here. If 10 is required, change `fail_retry = 10`.
- Session idle timeout (15 minutes) is typically handled via PAM configurations, not `pwquality.conf`.
- MFA, biometric, and other authentication methods are not configurable in `pwquality.conf` and require separate system configurations.
- Procedural requirements like changing vendor defaults, removing inactive accounts, and avoiding hardcoded passwords are not directly configurable in this file.
