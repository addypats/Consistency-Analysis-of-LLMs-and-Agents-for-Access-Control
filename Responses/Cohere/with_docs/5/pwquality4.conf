```

**Additional Notes:**
- **Idle session timeout (15 minutes):** This requires configuration in `/etc/profile` or `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` (e.g., `ClientAliveInterval 900` and `ClientAliveCountMax 0` for SSH).
- **MFA enforcement:** Implement via PAM modules like `pam_google_authenticator` or `pam_u2f`.
- **Script password management:** Enforce via scripting best practices and periodic audits.
- **Vendor defaults and account management:** Handle during system setup and periodic reviews.
