# Session idle timeout (handled by PAM, not directly in pwquality.conf)
# Note: This requires additional PAM configuration, e.g., in /etc/pam.d/common-auth or similar.

# Additional notes:
# - Vendor defaults and unnecessary accounts should be managed separately.
# - MFA and other authentication methods require additional configuration outside of pwquality.conf.
# - Hardcoded passwords in scripts should be avoided and managed through secure practices.
```

**Additional Configuration Notes:**
- **Session Idle Timeout:** To enforce a 15-minute idle session timeout, configure PAM with `pam_unix.so` or `pam_idle.so` in `/etc/pam.d/common-auth` or similar files.
- **MFA and Authentication Methods:** Implement MFA using tools like `google-authenticator`, `duo-unix`, or similar, and configure them in PAM or SSH settings.
- **Password Storage and Transmission:** Ensure encryption for authentication mechanisms by using protocols like SSH, TLS, and secure storage practices.
- **Script Password Management:** Use secure vaults or secrets managers to handle passwords in scripts, avoiding hardcoding.
