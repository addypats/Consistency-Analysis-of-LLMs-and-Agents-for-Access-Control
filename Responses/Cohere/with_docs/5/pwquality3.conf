```

**Additional Notes:**
- **Idle Session Timeout (15 minutes):** This requires configuration in `/etc/profile` or `/etc/bashrc` using `TMOUT=900`.
- **MFA and Authentication Methods:** These require additional tools like PAM modules (e.g., `pam_google_authenticator`, `pam_u2f`) and system-specific configurations.
- **Password Storage/Transmission Encryption:** Ensure PAM modules like `pam_unix` or `pam_ldap` are configured to use encrypted protocols (e.g., LDAPS) and that passwords are hashed with strong algorithms (e.g., `sha512`).
- **Password Hardcoding:** This is a policy enforcement issue and requires manual code reviews and scripting best practices.
- **MFA Documentation:** Implement logging mechanisms to capture MFA usage (e.g., `auth.log` with `pam_tty_audit`).
