**Additional Notes for Full Compliance:**
- **Idle Session Timeout (15 minutes):** Configure via `/etc/pam.d/system-auth` or `/etc/profile` using `TMOUT=900`.
- **MFA Enforcement:** Implement via PAM modules like `pam_google_authenticator` or `pam_u2f`.
- **Password Hardcoding:** Enforce via scripting standards and periodic audits.
- **Vendor Defaults & Unnecessary Accounts:** Manually address during system setup.
