# Enforce password change every 90 days

# Disable vendor-supplied defaults and unnecessary accounts
# Note: This is a procedural requirement and cannot be directly configured in pwquality.conf

# Session idle timeout (handled by PAM configuration, not pwquality.conf)
# Note: Configure PAM to enforce 15-minute idle session timeout

# MFA and other authentication methods
# Note: MFA and other authentication methods are typically configured in PAM and other security modules, not pwquality.conf

# Password storage and transmission encryption
# Note: Ensure encryption is enabled in PAM and system-wide configurations

# Prevent hardcoded passwords in scripts
# Note: This is a procedural requirement and cannot be directly configured in pwquality.conf
```

**Additional Notes:**
- The `lockout_time` is set to 1800 seconds (30 minutes) as per the policy.
- The `fail_retry` is set to 6 attempts, but another requirement mentions 10 attempts. Since pwquality.conf only supports one value, prioritize the stricter requirement (6 attempts) or configure the remaining lockout policy via PAM.
- Session idle timeout and MFA enforcement require additional configuration in PAM and other security modules.
- Procedural requirements (e.g., disabling default accounts, preventing hardcoded passwords) must be handled separately.
