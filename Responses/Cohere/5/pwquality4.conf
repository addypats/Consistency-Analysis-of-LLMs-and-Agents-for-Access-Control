```plaintext
# /etc/security/pwquality.conf

# Minimum password length
minlen = 12

# Require both numeric and alphabetic characters
dcredit = -1
ucredit = -1
ocredit = -1
lcredit = -1

# Password expiration and history
minage = 90
maxage = 90
remember = 4

# Lockout policy
fail_retry = 6
lockout_time = 1800  # 30 minutes

# Enforce password change on first use (handled via scripts or admin policy)
# Note: This requires additional scripting or manual intervention as pwquality.conf does not directly support this.

# MFA and other policies are enforced at the application or system level, not directly in pwquality.conf.
# Ensure MFA is implemented via PAM configuration or other system mechanisms.

# Idle session timeout (handled via PAM or system settings, not pwquality.conf)
# Example PAM configuration for session timeout:
# session required pam_timeout.so timeout=900

# Password complexity and other policies are enforced by the above settings.
# Ensure scripts do not hardcode passwords and follow periodic change policies via external mechanisms.
```

**Notes:**
- The `lockout_time` is set to 1800 seconds (30 minutes).
- The `fail_retry` is set to 6 attempts, but another requirement mentions 10 attempts. Adjust `fail_retry = 10` if that takes precedence.
- Some policies (e.g., first-time password change, MFA, idle session timeout, and script password management) require additional configuration outside of `pwquality.conf`, such as PAM modules or administrative scripts.
- Ensure compliance with all requirements by reviewing and implementing necessary changes in related system configurations.
