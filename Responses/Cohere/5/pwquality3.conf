**Additional Notes for Full Compliance:**
- **Idle Session Timeout (15 minutes):** Configure via `/etc/pam.d/system-auth` or `/etc/profile` using `TMOUT=900`.
- **MFA Enforcement:** Implement via PAM modules like `pam_google_authenticator` or `pam_u2f`.
- **Script Password Management:** Enforce via coding standards and periodic audits.
- **Vendor Defaults & Unnecessary Accounts:** Manually remove/disable during system setup.
- **Inactive Account Removal:** Automate via cron jobs or identity management tools.
- **Compromised Password Change:** Monitor via intrusion detection systems and enforce manual resets.
