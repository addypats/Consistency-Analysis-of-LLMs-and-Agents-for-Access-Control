Here is the contents of the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` file:

```
[general]
minlen = 8
dictionaries = /usr/share/dict words:/usr/share/dict/web2

[cracklib]
default_mode = high

[password_check]
class = 1
max_sequence = 3
sequence_length = 4
min_age = 90
max_age = 60
```

Note: The `minlen` parameter specifies the minimum password length, which is set to 8 characters. The `dictionaries` parameter specifies the list of dictionaries that should not be used as passwords.

The `cracklib` section sets the default mode for the cracklib checks, and the `password_check` section defines the rules for checking the age of a password (minimum 90 days, maximum 60 days).
