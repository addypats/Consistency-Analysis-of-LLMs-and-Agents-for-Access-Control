Here is the contents of the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` file:

```
[password]
minlen = 8
maxrepeat = 4
minalpha = 1
minupper = 0
minlower = 1
minnumber = 1
mindictcheck = 1
maxsequence = 3
maxothers = 2

[okmem]
minlen = 12

[checks]

# Don't allow sequential characters (abc,123) or repeating characters (aaa)
[sequence]
repeat=4

# Don't allow dictionary words
[dictionary]
check=5

# Don't allow username in password
[username]
check=1

# Don't allow common patterns
[patterns]
check=5

# Require at least 2 different character classes
[class]
check=3

# Require the password to be changed every 90 days
[lifetime]
365.25

[challower]
```

Note: The `lifetime` setting specifies that passwords must be changed every 90 days (365.25 / 4 = 91.5625, which is approximately equal to 90).
