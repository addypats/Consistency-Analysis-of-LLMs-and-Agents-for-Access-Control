Here is the contents of the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` file:
```
[password]
minlen = 8
minclass = 1
[dictionary]
enable = true
level = medium
[credexp]
max seq = 3
[aging]
interval = 90
[maxfail]
max_failures = 5
[mangle]
enforce_ugeneraldict = true
```
Here's a brief explanation of each setting:

* `minlen = 8`: The minimum length for a password is 8 characters.
* `minclass = 1`: A password must contain at least one character from the following classes: alpha, numeric, or special.
* `[dictionary]` enables dictionary-based password checking, with a medium-level complexity check.
* `[credexp]` restricts consecutive sequences of characters to no more than 3.
* `[aging]` sets the maximum age for passwords to 90 days.
* `[maxfail]` sets the maximum number of failed login attempts before account lockout to 5.
* `[mangle]` enables general dictionary-based password checking, which includes checks for common words and patterns.

Note that these settings may need to be adjusted or customized based on your specific security requirements.
