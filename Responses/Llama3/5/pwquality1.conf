Here is a sample `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` file based on the provided password policy rules:

```
[general]
minlen = 12
dictionaries = /usr/share/dictwords,/usr/share/dictmail
badpasswords = /path/to/bad-passwords.txt
[cracklib]
default_mode = enable
minlen = 7
[arithmetic]
check_root_no_password = true
[problems]
min_uses = 4
max_repeats = 0

[users]
min_age = 90
max_age = -1
warn_age = 60
```

Please note that this is just a sample configuration file, and you may need to adjust it according to your specific requirements. Additionally, the exact syntax and options in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` file might vary depending on the Linux distribution or version you are using.
