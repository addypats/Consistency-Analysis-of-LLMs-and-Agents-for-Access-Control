Here is a sample `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` file that enforces these password policy rules:

```
[default]
minlen = 8
dictpath = /usr/share/dict/cracklib_passwords
maxsequence = 1
minclass = 1
usercheck = 0
maxrepeat = 3
maxsequence = 1
minpasses = 3

[class]
minlen = 8
```

Here's a brief explanation of each setting:

* `minlen = 8`: The password must be at least 8 characters long.
* `dictpath = /usr/share/dict/cracklib_passwords`: The dictionary file used for checking words against the cracklib directory. In this case, it's the default path for the cracklib password list.
* `maxsequence = 1`: This setting prevents a sequence of three or more characters from appearing in the new password if they appeared in the old password. Since you want at least one character to be different from the old password, we set it to 1.
* `minclass = 1`: The password must contain at least one character that is not contained in the old password (i.e., at least one "new" character).
* `usercheck = 0`: This setting prevents the username from being used as part of the new password. We set it to 0 because you want this rule enforced.
* `maxrepeat = 3`: The maximum number of repeated characters allowed in a password. In this case, we allow up to 3 repeated characters before considering the password weak.
* `minpasses = 3`: The minimum number of valid passwords required for a new password to be accepted. This is related to the retries mechanism - if the user fails to create a valid password after three attempts, an error will be returned.

The `[class]` section is used to specify additional rules or overrides for specific user classes. In this case, we're simply repeating the `minlen = 8` setting from the `[default]` section to ensure that all users meet the minimum length requirement.
