Here is a sample `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` file that implements the desired password policy rules:

```
[password_settings]
minlen = 8
minclass = 1
maxsequence = 0
dictionaries = /usr/share/dict/cracklib_dict
enable_startend = 1
off_by_one_login = 1

[class]
characters = a-zA-Z0-9
min = 1

[sequence]
sequence_length = 3

[reject_username]
username_max_length = 8
```

Let me explain what each line does:

* `minlen = 8`: Sets the minimum password length to 8 characters.
* `minclass = 1`: Requires at least one character that isn't in the old password.
* `maxsequence = 0`: Disables sequence checking, which prevents passwords from containing common sequences like "abcd".
* `dictionaries = /usr/share/dict/cracklib_dict`: Specifies the cracklib dictionary file to use for checking against common words and phrases.
* `enable_startend = 1`: Allows passwords that start or end with a sequence of characters (e.g., "abc" or "XYZ").
* `off_by_one_login = 1`: Disables the "off by one" login attempt feature, which would allow up to three incorrect login attempts before returning an error.
* `[class]` defines a class of password requirements:
	+ `characters = a-zA-Z0-9`: Specifies that the password must contain at least one character from the set of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, or special characters.
	+ `min = 1`: Sets the minimum number of characters in this class to 1.
* `[sequence]` defines sequence requirements:
	+ `sequence_length = 3`: Prevents passwords that contain sequences of three or more identical characters (e.g., "aaa" or "123").
* `[reject_username]` defines username-related password restrictions:
	+ `username_max_length = 8`: Sets the maximum length of the username that can be used in a password.

Note that this file is just an example, and you may need to adjust it to fit your specific requirements. Additionally, the PAM module (libpam) must be configured to use this file for the password policy to take effect.
