Here is the contents of the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` file:

```
[general]
minlen = 8
maxrepeat = 0
dcredit = -1
ucredit = -1
ocredit = 0
ncrhackit = true
minclass = 1

[cracklib]
default_mode = check
report_username = yes
dictionary = /usr/share/dict/cracklib_small_dict
```

Note:

* `minlen = 8` sets the minimum password length to 8 characters.
* The remaining options in the `[general]` section enforce the rules you specified:
	+ `minclass = 1` ensures that at least one character in the new password is not present in the old password.
	+ `maxrepeat = 0` disallows consecutive repeated characters (e.g., "aaaa").
	+ `dcredit`, `ucredit`, and `ocredit` control the number of digits, uppercase letters, and other characters required.
	+ `ncrhackit = true` enables the PAM module to enforce these rules.
* The `[cracklib]` section tells pwquality to use the cracklib dictionary to check for common words not allowed in passwords.
