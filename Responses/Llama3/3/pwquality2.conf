Here is the contents of the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` file:

[general]
minlen = 8
dictionaries = /usr/share/dict/cracklib.dict
dict_check.enable = Yes
minclass = 1
enable cracking = no
recheck_module = pam_pwquality.so

[cracklib]
default_mode = enable

[arbitrary_password_blacklist]
enable = yes
words_file = /usr/share/pwquality/pwblacklist.txt

[toggle]
min_age = 0

Note:

* The `minlen` option sets the minimum password length to 8 characters.
* The `dictionaries` option specifies the location of the cracklib dictionary file, which is used to check for common passwords.
* The `dict_check.enable` option enables cracklib checking.
* The `minclass` option requires at least one character that isn't in the old password.
* The `recheck_module` option specifies the PAM module to use for enforcing the password policy.
* The `cracklib` section is enabled by default, which checks if the new password contains any words from the cracklib dictionary.
* The `arbitrary_password_blacklist` section allows you to specify a file containing a list of passwords that are not allowed (in this case, it's an empty list).
* The `toggle` section is used for debugging purposes and sets the minimum age of a password to 0.

Please note that you should adjust the path to the cracklib dictionary file (`/usr/share/dict/cracklib.dict`) according to your system configuration.
