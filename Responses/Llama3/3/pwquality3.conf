Here is a sample `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` file that enforces the password policy rules you specified:

```
[general]
minlen = 8
maxsequence = 1
minclass = 1
[dictionary]
minudigest = 4
[maxfail]
max_failures = 3

[arbitrary]
check_userpass = Yes
```

Let me explain the settings:

* `minlen = 8`: The new password must be at least 8 characters long.
* `maxsequence = 1`: This ensures that there is at least one character in the new password that isn't in the old password (i.e., it's not a trivial update).
* `minclass = 1`: This requires at least one character from each of the following classes: uppercase, lowercase, digit, special character. Since you didn't specify exact requirements for these classes, I set it to `1`, which means that any new password must contain at least one character from one of these classes.
* `[dictionary]`:
	+ `minudigest = 4`: This setting is related to the CrackLib dictionary check. It ensures that the new password is not found in the dictionary (i.e., it's not a common word). The value `4` means that at least four characters must be unique.
* `[maxfail]`:
	+ `max_failures = 3`: This sets the maximum number of failed attempts before returning an error. In this case, you can try to set the password up to three times before it's considered invalid.
* `[arbitrary]`:
	+ `check_userpass = Yes`: This setting is specific to PAM and requires that the username be checked against the new password (to prevent using the username as part of the password).

Please note that you may need to adjust these settings based on your specific requirements or organizational policies.
