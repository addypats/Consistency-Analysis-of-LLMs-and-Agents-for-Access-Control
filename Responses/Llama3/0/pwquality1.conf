Here is the contents of the /etc/security/pwquality.conf file based on your requirements:

```
# Maximum time between two password changes
max_days = 90

# Minimum length for passwords
min_length = 10

# Check for valid password types (add more as needed)
valid_password_types = "alnum"
valid_password_types += "a-z A-Z !@#$%^&*_+=?/~’;’,<>|"

# Exclude common patterns
exclude_patterns = "^default$|^password$|^qwerty$|^123456$|^666666$|^abc123$|^def456$|^xyz789$"

# Exclude dictionary words
dictionary_files = "/usr/share/dict/words /etc/passwords"

# Exclude common words and phrases
common_words = "the quick brown fox \
  abc def ghi jkl mno pqr stu vwx yz"
```

Note that the `/usr/share/dict/words` file is a default dictionary word list, but you can adjust it according to your system's requirements. Additionally, you may need to update the `dictionary_files` and `common_words` variables based on your system's configuration.

Please note that this is just an example configuration, and you should consult with your system administrator or security team before making any changes to your system's password policy.
