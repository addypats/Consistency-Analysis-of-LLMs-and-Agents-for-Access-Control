Here is a sample `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` file that implements the specified password policy rules:

[general]
minlen = 10
max repeat = 0
local_users_only = 0
badcount = 3
goodcount = 1

[expiration]
expiredate = +90

[strength]
lcredit = 1
ocredit = 1
ecredit = 1
dcredit = 2

[class]
checkpass = pwquality

Note:

* `minlen` sets the minimum password length to 10 characters.
* `max repeat` disables password reuse for a year (365 days).
* `local_users_only` is set to 0, which means the policy applies to all users.
* `badcount` and `goodcount` are used to enforce password quality; you can adjust these values as needed.
* `expiredate` sets the password expiration period to 90 days.
* The `[strength]` section defines the strength requirements:
	+ `lcredit`: allows lowercase letters
	+ `ocredit`: allows uppercase letters
	+ `ecredit`: allows special characters (!@#$%^&*_+=?/~’;’,<>|\)
	+ `dcredit`: disallows dictionary words and acronyms (default is 2, which means at least one non-dictionary character is required)
* The `[class]` section specifies that the pwquality plugin should be used to check passwords.

Remember to adjust these settings according to your specific security requirements and computing system capabilities.
