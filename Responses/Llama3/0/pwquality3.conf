Here is a sample /etc/security/pwquality.conf file with the specified password policy rules:

```
DEFAULTPolicy=strict
MAX_LENGTH=10
TEST_PATTERNS=".*[@#$%^&*_+=?/~’;’,<>\|].*"
MINÚMIN_LENGTH=10
DICTIONARY_FILE=/usr/share/dict/words
EXPIRE_DAYS=90
REUSE_TIME=31536000 # 1 year in seconds
```

Note: The dictionary file `/usr/share/dict/words` may not contain all the words you want to exclude, and it's recommended to update or create a custom dictionary for your system.
