Here is the /etc/security/pwquality.conf file that you requested:

[general]
minlen = 8
maxlen = 15

[checking]
sequence = 1
dict_check = 1

[expBLACKLIST]
expire_days = 90

[cracklib]
default_mode = high

Note: The password policy rules are set as follows:

- `minlen` sets the minimum length of a password to 8 characters. The maximum length is set to 15 characters.
- `sequence` checks for sequential number strings in passwords and disallows them.
- `dict_check` screens new passwords against lists of previously compromised passwords and rejects those that have already been breached.
- `expire_days` sets the expiration period for passwords, requiring users to change their passwords every 90 days.

Keep in mind that these settings are just a sample configuration, and you may need to adjust them based on your organization's specific needs.
