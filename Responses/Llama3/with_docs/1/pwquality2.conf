Here is the contents of a /etc/security/pwquality.conf file that meets your requirements:

```
# Configuration for pwquality

# Password complexity rules
minlen = 15
maxlen = 64

# Check for sequential characters
seqcheck = on
seqwordlist = /usr/share/passwords/sequential

# Check for common words
commonwordlist = /etc/security/commonwords
commonwordcheck = on

# Check for breached passwords
breachedcheck = yes
breachedusercheck = yes
breachedpasscheck = yes

# Disable password hints
hintcheck = no

# Allow long passwords (NIST recommendation)
passphrasecheck = yes
passphrasemaxlen = 64

# Recommend long passwords over complex ones
longcheck = yes

# Enable multi-factor authentication
mfacheck = on

# Note: risk-based authentication techniques are not yet implemented in pwquality
riskbasedcheck = no
```

Please note that you will need to create the necessary directories and files (e.g. `/usr/share/passwords/sequential`, `etc/security/commonwords`) for these settings to work properly.
