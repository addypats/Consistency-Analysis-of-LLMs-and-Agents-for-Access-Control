Here is the generated `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` file:
```
[general]
minlen = 8
maxlen = 15

[checkpass]
minlen = 15

[dictionary]
badwords = /usr/share/dict/passwd:/usr/share/secedit/passwd.txt

[stopforeverything]
compilers:/usr/bin/awk:/bin/sh:/bin/bash:/usr/bin/perl:/usr/bin/python
sequential:1:3:4:5:6:7:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15:20:30:40:50

[cracklib]
default_mode = low

[arbitrary]
ignorecase = 0
```
Note:

* `minlen` sets the minimum password length to 8 and maximum to 15.
* `checkpass` has a separate minimum length of 15, which overrides the general setting.
* The `dictionary` section includes lists of previously compromised passwords to screen against.
* The `stopforeverything` section disallows common strings like sequential numbers and common words like "password".
* The `cracklib` section is set to low mode to prevent predictable passwords.
* The `arbitrary` section sets the case sensitivity to 0, allowing for longer passphrases.
