Here is the generated `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` file:

```
[default]
minlen = 8
maxlen = 15
dictpath = /usr/share/pylib/dict.txt
reject_username_words = true
minclass = 1
enforce_group_rotation = no
sequence_blacklist_length = 6
[general]
```

Here's a brief explanation of each setting:

* `minlen = 8` and `maxlen = 15`: Set the minimum password length to 8 characters and the maximum length to 15 characters.
* `dictpath = /usr/share/pylib/dict.txt`: Specify the location of the dictionary file used for password strength checking. This file contains a list of common words and phrases that are not considered strong passwords.
* `reject_username_words = true`: Reject passwords that contain common username-related words, such as "password".
* `minclass = 1`: Set the minimum number of character classes required in a password (e.g., uppercase letters, digits, etc.). In this case, it's set to 1, which means at least one character class is required.
* `enforce_group_rotation = no`: This setting is not relevant for your requirements, so I left it as the default value (`no`).
* `sequence_blacklist_length = 6`: Set the length of sequential number strings that will be rejected. In this case, any sequence of 6 or more numbers in a row will be considered weak.

Note that I did not include rules for password hints, special characters, or multi-factor authentication, as these are external recommendations and not directly related to the `pwquality.conf` file.
