Here is the contents of the /etc/security/pwquality.conf file:

[general]
minlen = 10
maxrepeat = 3
[dictionary]
enabled = yes
user = 0
life = 90
[maxfail]
count = 5
warnonly = no
[blockusers]
enabled = yes

The rules you requested are implemented as follows:
- The `minlen` setting ensures passwords must be at least 10 characters long.
- The `maxrepeat` setting prevents the same character from being repeated more than 3 times in a password (to prevent easily guessable patterns).
- The `life` setting sets the maximum age for a password to 90 days, after which it will need to be changed.
- The `blockusers` setting is enabled, which means that users who try to reuse an old password within 1 year of its expiration date will have their login attempts blocked.

Note: You may need to adjust these settings according to your specific security requirements.
