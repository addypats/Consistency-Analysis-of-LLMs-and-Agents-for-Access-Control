Here is the contents of the /etc/security/pwquality.conf file that meets your requirements:

```
[general]
max_age = 90

[password]
minlen = 10
dictionaries_limit = 0
lcredit = 1
ucredit = 1
ocredit = 1

[checks]
check_userpass = 1
```

Explanation of the settings:

* `[general]`: This section sets the maximum password age to 90 days.
* `[password]`:
	+ `minlen = 10`: Sets the minimum password length to 10 characters.
	+ `dictionaries_limit = 0`: Disables dictionary-based checks, as you wanted no dictionary words or acronyms in passwords.
	+ `lcredit = 1`, `ucredit = 1`, and `ocredit = 1`: Enables credit for lowercase letters (l), uppercase letters (u), and other characters (o) respectively, ensuring a mix of character types.
* `[checks]`:
	+ `check_userpass = 1`: Enables checking the password against username-related information to prevent easily guessable passwords.

Note that you may need to adjust this configuration file based on your specific system's requirements and security policies.
