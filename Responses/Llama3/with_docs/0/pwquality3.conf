Here is a `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` file that enforces the desired password policy rules:

```
[password]
minlen = 10
max-repeat = 0

[enable]  
crit-password = 3
```

Let me explain what each line does:

* `minlen = 10`: sets the minimum allowed password length to 10 characters.
* `max-repeat = 0`: prevents password reuse by setting a maximum number of consecutive repeated passwords to 0. This means that every new password must be different from the previous one.
* `[enable]` : enables pwquality's password complexity checking and aging.
* `crit-password = 3` : sets the password age critical threshold to 90 days (i.e., after 90 days, the password is considered too old).

Please note that this configuration file assumes you have already installed and configured the `pwquality` package on your system.
