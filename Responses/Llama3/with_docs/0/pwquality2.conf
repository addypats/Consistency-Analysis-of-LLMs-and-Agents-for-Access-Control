Here is a /etc/security/pwquality.conf file that meets your requirements:

```
[general]
min_length = 10
max_age = 90

[checks]
enable_weak_logins = yes

[complexity]
check_userpass = yes
diction_size = 13600
min_classchars = 1
min_lowercase = 1
min_uppercase = 1
min_special = 1
min_digit = 1

[history]
max_reuse = 1
```

Note: The `enable_weak_logins` option is enabled to prevent weak passwords from being accepted. This includes passwords that are not complex enough or do not meet the length requirement.

The `check_userpass` option checks if the password contains any information about the user (e.g., username, social security number), and disallows it.

The `diction_size` option sets the size of the dictionary file used to check for dictionary words. A value of 13600 is a common setting that includes many English words and common acronyms.

The `min_classchars` options set the minimum number of characters from each class (alpha, numeric, special) required in the password.

Finally, the `max_reuse` option sets the maximum number of times a password can be reused to 1, which means that users must change their passwords at least once every year.
