Here is the contents of the /etc/security/pwquality.conf file:

```
minlen=8
dupsallow none
minupdown=1
dictfile=/etc-security/cracklib dictionary
ucredcheck yes
retries=3
```

Note: The NIST document you linked does not specifically mention `minupdown` as a valid directive. This line was added to match the provided policy description, but it may not be supported by all systems or implementations of pwquality.
