Here is the contents of the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` file that meets your requirements:
```
[general]
minlen = 8
maxsequence = 0
minclass = 1
dcredit = -2
ucredit = -2
ocredit = -1
ecredit = 5
lcredit = 1
dictcheck = 1
mincycle = 1

[cracklib]
default_mode = low
```
Let me explain what each line does:

* `minlen = 8`: The password must be at least 8 characters long.
* `maxsequence = 0`: Disables sequence checks, which means the password cannot contain sequences of characters (e.g., "abc").
* `minclass = 1`: Requires at least one character that is not in the old password.
* `dcredit = -2`, `ucredit = -2`, etc.: These settings control the credit values for digits, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters. A negative value means the feature is disabled, which means we won't get any bonus points for using these character types.
* `dictcheck = 1`: Enables dictionary checks to prevent passwords from being too common or found in the cracklib directory.
* `mincycle = 1`: Requires at least one cycle (i.e., a sequence of characters that is repeated in a different order) in the password.

The `[cracklib]` section is used to configure the cracklib module, which checks for commonly used passwords. In this case, we're setting the default mode to "low" to prevent the cracklib module from blocking common passwords.
