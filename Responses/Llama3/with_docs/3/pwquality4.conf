Here is the contents of the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` file that enforces the specified password policy rules:

```
[general]
minlen = 8
dcredit = -1
ucredit = -1
ocredit = -1
lcredit = -1
dict_check = yes
maxsequence = 4
minclass = 3

[acrack]
maxsequence = 0
```

Let me explain the settings:

* `minlen = 8`: Ensures that the new password is at least 8 characters long.
* `dcredit = -1`, `ucredit = -1`, `ocredit = -1`, and `lcredit = -1`: Disables all credit checks (digits, uppercase letters, etc.), which means that passwords must not contain any of these characters. This rule helps prevent simple substitutions (e.g., "Password" becoming "P@ssw0rd").
* `dict_check = yes`: Enables the cracklib dictionary check to ensure that the password does not appear in the cracklib directory.
* `maxsequence = 4`: Allows a maximum sequence of 4 identical characters in the new password. This helps prevent simple substitutions like "aaaa" or "1111".
* `minclass = 3`: Requires at least 3 character classes (digits, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters) to be present in the new password.
* `[acrack]`: This section is used to configure the PAM module's password quality checks. The `maxsequence = 0` setting means that passwords must not contain any sequences of more than 0 identical characters.

Note that you may need to adjust these settings based on your specific requirements and organizational policies.
