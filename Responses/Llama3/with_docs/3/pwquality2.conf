Here is the contents of the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` file that implements the password policy rules you specified:

```
[general]
minlen = 8
dictpath = /usr/share/dict/cracklib_wordlist
minclass = 1
[checks]
skipsymbol = O0Oo9i2Lk3mM5pP
[credcomplient]
credit -1
[maxsequence]
sequence = 0
[maxrepeat]
repeat = 0
```

Let me explain what each line does:

* `[general]`: This is the top-level section for general password quality settings.
	+ `minlen = 8`: The minimum length of a password that will be accepted. In this case, it's 8 characters long.
	+ `dictpath = /usr/share/dict/cracklib_wordlist`: This tells pwquality where to find the cracklib dictionary file for checking words against.
	+ `minclass = 1`: The minimum number of character classes (letters, numbers, symbols) that must be used in a password. In this case, it's at least one class.
* `[checks]`: This section defines special checks for passwords.
	+ `skipsymbol = O0Oo9i2Lk3mM5pP`: This line specifies a set of characters to skip when checking the password against the cracklib dictionary. In this case, it's skipping certain letters and numbers that are often used in passwords.
* `[credcomplient]`: This section controls how pwquality handles credit (i.e., whether the new password is an improvement over the old one).
	+ `credit -1`: This sets the credit value to -1. If the credit value is negative, pwquality will require the new password to be different from the old one in at least one character.
* `[maxsequence]` and `[maxrepeat]`: These sections control how many times a sequence or repeat of characters can appear in a password before it's rejected.
	+ `sequence = 0`: This sets the maximum sequence length to 0, which means pwquality won't reject passwords for having sequences that are too long.
	+ `repeat = 0`: This sets the maximum repetition count to 0, which means pwquality won't reject passwords for having repeated characters that are too common.

Note that you may need to adjust the `dictpath` value if you have a custom cracklib dictionary file or location.
