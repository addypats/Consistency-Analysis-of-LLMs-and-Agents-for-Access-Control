Here is the contents of the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` file that enforces the desired password policy rules:

```
[general]
minlen = 8
dict_check = 1
dictionnaire = /usr/share/dict/cracklib_wordlist
skip_dictionnaire = 0
local_charset = 
minclass = 1
[class]
lcredit = 1

[arbitrary]
check_pwsuse = 3
```

Let me explain each line:

* `[general]`: This is the main section of the configuration file.
* `minlen = 8`: The minimum length of a password must be at least 8 characters long.
* `dict_check = 1`: Enables dictionary checking, which will reject passwords that contain common words or phrases.
* `dictionnaire = /usr/share/dict/cracklib_wordlist`: Specifies the path to the cracklib wordlist file. This is used to check if a password contains any known words.
* `skip_dictionnaire = 0`: Skips the dictionary checking for passwords that contain at least one character not found in the wordlist (i.e., the rule you specified).
* `local_charset = ``: Specifies the local character set, which is empty by default. This setting can be adjusted to allow or disallow specific characters.
* `minclass = 1`: The minimum number of character classes that a password must contain, where "classes" refers to uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. In this case, the policy requires at least one character that isn't in the old password (i.e., not found in the wordlist).
* `[class]`: This section defines rules for specific character classes.
* `lcredit = 1`: The minimum number of characters that must be from a locale-specific set. In this case, it means that at least one character must be different from those found in the old password.

Finally, the `[arbitrary]` section specifies additional rules:

* `check_pwsuse = 3`: Specifies the maximum number of times a user can retry entering their new password before an error is returned. In this case, it's set to 3 retries.
