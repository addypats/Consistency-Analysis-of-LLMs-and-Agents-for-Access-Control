Here is the contents of the /etc/security/pwquality.conf file based on the provided password policy rules:

```
# Minimum password age in days
min_password_age=90

# Disable weak dictionary words
disable_weak_dict 1
disable_low_complexity 0

# Require at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit
require_uppercase 0
require_lowercase 0
require_digit 0
require_punct 0
require_numbers 1
require_uppercase_length 1
require_lowercase_length 1
require_digit_length 1

# Password must be at least 8 characters long
min_password_length=8

# Disable password checking for users in the "wheel" group, who need to change their passwords daily
group_wheel 0

# Disable password expiration checking, since we enforce a minimum age of 90 days instead
check_expire 0

# Require at most one password reset attempt within two days
max_reset_attempts 1
reset_attempt_window=2
```

Please note that the "disable_weak_dict" setting might not be exactly what you want, as it's used to disable checking for weak dictionary words. Instead, you should use `check_password` with a dictionary size limit and only check if the password contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit.

Here is an updated version of the /etc/security/pwquality.conf file:

```
# Minimum password age in days
min_password_age=90

# Check passwords against a limited dictionary
check_password {
    dictionary_file = /usr/share/dict/words
    min_dict_len = 3
    max_dict_len = 5
}

# Require at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit
require_uppercase 1
require_lowercase 1
require_digit 1

# Password must be at least 8 characters long
min_password_length=8

# Disable password checking for users in the "wheel" group, who need to change their passwords daily
group_wheel 0

# Disable password expiration checking, since we enforce a minimum age of 90 days instead
check_expire 0

# Require at most one password reset attempt within two days
max_reset_attempts 1
reset_attempt_window=2
```
