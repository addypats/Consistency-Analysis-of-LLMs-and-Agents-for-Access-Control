Here is the contents of the /etc/security/pwquality.conf file that enforces the specified password policy rules:

[general]
minlen = 8
max_repeat = 1
oauth_min_len = 8
dictionary_attack_enabled = yes
badwords_file = /usr/share/pytrainer/dict.blacklist
dict_check_enabled = yes

[cracklib]
default_mode = high
minimum_length = 8
check_user_name = yes

[expire]
warn_days = 14
inactive_days = 30

[checks]
user = 1
name = 0
class = 1
digit = 1
upalpha = 1
special = 1
greet = 0

Note that some of the options may have default values, but I've included them all to ensure that the desired policies are enforced.
