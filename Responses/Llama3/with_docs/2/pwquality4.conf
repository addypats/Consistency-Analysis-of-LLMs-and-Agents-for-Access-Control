Here is the contents of the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` file that enforces the specified password policy rules:

```
[general]
minlen = 8
dictpath = /usr/share/dict/
minclass = 1
maxsequence = 4
minalpha = 1
minbeta = 0
mingamma = 0
mingamma = 0
minothers = 1

[checkpass]
maxrepeat = 3

[expiration]
expireafter = 90 days

[changepw]
pwchange_min_days = 2
```

Let me explain what each section does:

* `[general]`: This section sets general password policy rules.
	+ `minlen`: The minimum length of a password (8 characters in this case).
	+ `dictpath`: Path to the dictionary file used for password strength checks. You can leave this as is, or change it if you need to customize your dictionary.
	+ `minclass`: The minimum number of character classes required in a password (1 alpha and 1 numeric character, in this case).
	+ `maxsequence`: Maximum length of a sequence of repeated characters (4 in this case). This helps prevent simple sequential guesses like "abc123".
* `[checkpass]`: This section checks the strength of the password.
	+ `maxrepeat`: The maximum number of repeated characters allowed (3 in this case).
* `[expiration]`: This section sets password expiration policies.
	+ `expireafter`: Passwords expire after 90 days in this case, which means users are required to change their passwords at least every 90 days.
* `[changepw]`: This section sets password change policies.
	+ `pwchange_min_days`: Users can only change their passwords once every 2 days.

Note that you should adjust these settings according to your specific needs and organizational policies. Additionally, it's essential to keep in mind that while these rules help ensure strong passwords, they should not be considered a sole means of password security; other measures like multi-factor authentication and regular updates are also crucial.
