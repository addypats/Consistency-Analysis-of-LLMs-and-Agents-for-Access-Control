Here is the generated `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` file:
```
[general]
minlen = 8
dictionaries = /usr/share/dict
badwords = /usr/share/wordlist
max_repeat = 1
max_sequence = 4
[expire]
min_days = 90
[maxfail]
failcount = 3

[options]
minclass = 1
```
Let me explain the settings:

* `minlen = 8`: Set the minimum password length to 8 characters.
* `dictionaries = /usr/share/dict` and `badwords = /usr/share/wordlist`: Specify the paths to dictionaries of words that are not allowed as passwords. These are default locations on Arch Linux systems.
* `max_repeat = 1`: Prevent repeated characters (e.g., "aaa") in a password.
* `max_sequence = 4`: Prevent sequences of more than 4 identical characters (e.g., "aaaa" or "1111").
* `[expire]` section: Set the minimum number of days between password changes to 90, which is equivalent to the desired 3 months.
* `[maxfail]` section: Set the maximum number of failed login attempts before account lockout to 3.
* `[options]` section: Set `minclass = 1`, which requires at least one alpha and one numeric character in a password. This setting helps ensure that passwords are strong and not easily guessable.

Note that you may need to adjust these settings according to your specific requirements or organization's policies.
