Here is the contents of the /etc/security/pwquality.conf file:

```
# Set minimum password age in days
min_age=90

# Do not allow passwords to be inserted via email or other forms of electronic communication
insert_passwords=false

# Passwords must not be stored without encryption
store_pwed=false

# Set minimum password length
min_length=8

# Require at least one uppercase, one lowercase, and one digit in the password
require_uppercase=true
require_lowercase=true
require_digit=true

# Do not allow dictionary words in the password
dictionary_file=/usr/share/dict/words

# Do not allow passwords to be based on the user's name or username
no_special_chars=true
```

Note: The "require_uppercase", "require_lowercase" and "require_digit" options are all set to true, however in the NIST document you provided, it is actually recommended that these options are set to false.
