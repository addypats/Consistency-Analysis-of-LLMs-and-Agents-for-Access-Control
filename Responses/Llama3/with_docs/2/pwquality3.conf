Here is the generated `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` file:
```
[general]
minlen = 8
dictionaries = /usr/share/dict
[cracklib]
default_mode = high
minalpha = 1
minupper = 0
minlower = 1
minspecial = 0

[password_changes]
min_age = 90

[other]
prompt = Password must be at least 8 characters long and contain at least 1 alpha and 1 numeric character, should not be based on a dictionary word, and not be part of your name or user name.
```
Note:

* The `minlen` directive sets the minimum password length to 8 characters.
* The `dictionaries` directive specifies the path to the dictionary files used for password strength checking (in this case, `/usr/share/dict`).
* The `cracklib` section sets various cracklib-related parameters:
	+ `default_mode`: sets the default cracking mode to "high" (more stringent testing).
	+ `minalpha`, `minupper`, `minlower`, and `minspecial`: set the minimum number of each character type required in a password.
* The `[password_changes]` section sets the minimum time between password changes to 90 days.
* The `[other]` section contains an arbitrary message prompt that provides additional guidance on password strength requirements.

Please note that these settings may need to be adjusted based on your specific security requirements and organizational policies.
