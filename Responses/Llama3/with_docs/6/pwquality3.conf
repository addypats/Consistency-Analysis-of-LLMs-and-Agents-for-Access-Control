```

Note: The `exponential` retry interval type means that the minimum retry time will be doubled for each failed attempt, but it's capped at a maximum value. You can adjust this value according to your system constraints.

Also, you need to create the `/etc/pwquality/blacklist` file and populate it with known bad, weak, or previous 5 passwords as per your organization's requirements.

Please note that this configuration is based on the NIST guidelines (800-63B) and might require adjustments to suit your specific system and security policies. It's always recommended to consult with a security expert before configuring password policies on your system.
