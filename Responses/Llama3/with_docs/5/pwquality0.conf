Note: The above configuration assumes a Linux system. The exact configuration file format may vary depending on the operating system and its security policies.

This configuration adheres to the provided NIST guidelines for password policy (SP 800-63B), including requirements such as:

*   Minimum length of 7 characters
*   Presence of at least one digit, lowercase letter, and special character
*   Limiting repeated login attempts after 10 failures with a lockout duration of 30 minutes
*   Enforcing session timeout and idle threshold to prevent prolonged inactivity
*   Requiring MFA for CDE access and remote access
*   Implementing password history and rotation rules
*   Prohibiting hardcoded passwords
