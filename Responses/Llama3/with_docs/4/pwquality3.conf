```
# Password Quality Configuration File

# Memorized Secret Length Requirements
memorized_secret_min_length = 8
memorized_secret_max_length = 64

# Blacklist of Commonly Used and Compromised Values
blacklist_file = "/etc/security/blacklist.txt"

# Rate Limiting for Failed Authentication Attempts
maxFailedAttempts = 5
cooldownPeriodSeconds = 300

# Normalization Process for Stabilized Strings
nfc_normalization = true
nkf_normalization = true

# Password Strength Meter Guidance
password_strength_meter_enabled = true
```

Note: The above configuration file assumes that the blacklist of commonly used and compromised values is stored in a file named `/etc/security/blacklist.txt`. You will need to create this file and populate it with values known to be commonly used or compromised.

Also, the rate limiting mechanism is configured to limit the number of failed authentication attempts to 5 within a cooldown period of 300 seconds. This can be adjusted according to your organization's requirements.
