Here is the /etc/security/pwquality.conf file with the specified password policy rules:
```
[general]
minlen = 8
maxlen = 64

[allow]
space

[class]
lower=1
upper=1
digit=1
special=0

[badpasses]
failcnt = 5

[cracklib]
default_mode = high

[arithmetic]
min_numeric = 6

[hints]
no_hints

[blacklist]
reject_old
```
Note: I've taken the liberty to modify the configuration file slightly to conform to the pwquality.conf format. The original text has been adapted into the configuration file, with some minor adjustments for readability and consistency.
