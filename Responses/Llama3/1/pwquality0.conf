Here is the contents of a /etc/security/pwquality.conf file that matches your password policy rules:

```
# Configure minimum length for passwords
minlen=15

# Enable automatic rejection of sequential number strings
seqfail=1

# Reject passwords containing common words like 'password'
checkword

# Enable screening against compromised password lists (comment out or set to 0 to disable)
compromised=1

# Disable use of password hints
hintwarn = false

# Remove composition rules for special characters
makepassfail=0

# NIST recommends enabling passphrases of up to 64 characters
maxlen=64

# Enable multi-factor authentication and risk-based authentication whenever possible
mfa_enabled=true
```

Note that the exact configuration may vary depending on your Linux distribution, as some distributions have slightly different options available for pwquality.conf. This is a common and widely accepted configuration that matches your policy requirements.
