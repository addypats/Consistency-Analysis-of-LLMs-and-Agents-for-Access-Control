Here is the contents of the /etc/security/pwquality.conf file:

[password_length]
minlen = 8
maxlen = 15

[arbitrary_input_chars]
enable = 1

[check_user_password_blacklist]
user_check = 0
enforce_group_configuration = 1

[hinting]
enable_hint = 0

[compress]
enable_compress = 0

[class]
check_class = 0

Note: The NIST recommendation for passphrases is not directly implemented in pwquality.conf, as it does not provide a specific configuration option.
