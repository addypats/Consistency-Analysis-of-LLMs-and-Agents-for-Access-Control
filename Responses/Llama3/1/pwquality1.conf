Here is the contents of the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` file based on the provided password policy rules:

```
[general]
minlen = 8
dictionaries_limit = 0
[arithmetic]
min_unique = 1
[commonwords]
list = /path/to/common/words.txt
[dictionary]
user = /path/to/user/dictionary.txt
[bannedpasswords]
file = /path/to/breached/passwords.txt

[credinfo]
```

Note:

* `minlen` sets the minimum password length to 8 characters.
* `dictionaries_limit` is set to 0 to disable composition rules for special characters.
* The `[arithmetic]` and `[commonwords]` sections are included to screen new passwords against lists of previously compromised passwords and reject those that have already been breached.
* The `[dictionary]` section monitors newly registered passwords for obvious security weaknesses, like sequential number strings and common words like "password".
* The `[credinfo]` section is left empty as it's not explicitly mentioned in the rules. However, this section is typically used to specify additional password quality settings.

Please modify the file paths (`/path/to/common/words.txt`, `/path/to/user/dictionary.txt`, and `/path/to/breached/passwords.txt`) according to your specific setup.
