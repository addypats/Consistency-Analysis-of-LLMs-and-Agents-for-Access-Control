Here is the contents of a /etc/security/pwquality.conf file based on your requirements:

```
# Enforce minimum length
minlen=15

# Enable monitoring for sequential number strings
checksequence=on

# Enable checking against lists of previously compromised passwords
checkFailures=on

# Disable password hints
hintpolicy=never

# No composition rule required for special characters
specialchars=none

# Allow long passwords
maxfailtries=5
rmlen=1000
maxretries=3

# Recommend enabling passphrases of up to 64 characters
passphrase=on
passminlen=20
passmaxlen=64

# Enable multi-factor authentication and risk-based authentication techniques
mfa=on
risk_auth=on
```

Note that some of these settings may require adjustments based on your specific environment, such as the `maxfailtries`, `rmlen`, `maxretries` settings which control how many failed login attempts to allow.
