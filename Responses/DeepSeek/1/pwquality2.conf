```ini
# /etc/security/pwquality.conf

# Minimum password length
minlen = 8

# Recommended password length
minclass = 15

# Disable password hints
hints = 0

# Enable passphrases up to 64 characters
maxrepeat = 64

# Reject passwords found in compromised password lists
dictcheck = 1

# Reject common words and sequential patterns
usercheck = 1
enforcing = 1

# Disable composition rules (no mandatory special characters)
difok = 0
minclass = 0

# Encourage long passwords over complex ones
maxclassrepeat = 0
```

This configuration aligns with the provided password policy rules, emphasizing length over complexity, rejecting compromised passwords, and discouraging password hints. Multi-factor authentication and risk-based techniques are not directly configurable in `pwquality.conf` but should be implemented at the application or system level.
