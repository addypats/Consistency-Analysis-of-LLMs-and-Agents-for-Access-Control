# Minimum password length (8 characters)
minlen = 8

# Maximum password length (64 characters for passphrases)
maxlen = 64

# Disable password composition rules (no special character requirements)
minclass = 0

# Disable consecutive identical characters check
maxrepeat = 0

# Disable sequential character checks (like "12345" or "abcde")
maxsequence = 0

# Disable user/gecos check
usercheck = 0

# Enable dictionary check (common words like "password")
dictcheck = 1

# Enable check against previously compromised passwords
# Note: This requires additional setup with a breached password database
# such as haveibeenpwned or similar service integration
# (not directly configurable in pwquality.conf - requires external service)

# Disable password hints (handled at application level, not in pwquality)

# Additional security notes (not configurable in pwquality.conf):
# - Multi-factor authentication should be implemented at application level
# - Risk-based authentication should be implemented at application level
# - Password screening against breached databases requires external integration
