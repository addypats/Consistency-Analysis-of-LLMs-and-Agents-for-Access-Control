# Enforce password history (prevents reuse of compromised passwords)
# Note: This requires integration with password history system
# The actual screening against compromised password lists should be
# implemented at the application/authentication system level

# Disable password hints (should be configured at application level)
# This file cannot enforce this policy - must be implemented in applications

# Note: Multi-factor authentication and risk-based authentication
# must be configured at the authentication system/application level
