# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
# Password quality configuration

# Minimum password length (NIST recommends at least 8 characters)
minlen = 8

# Maximum password length (NIST recommends up to 64 characters)
maxlen = 64

# Disable composition rules (no longer required per NIST guidelines)
# This allows users to create passwords without forced special characters
minclass = 0

# Disable consecutive identical characters check
# (set to 0 to disable, or set to desired limit)
maxrepeat = 0

# Disable sequential character checks
# (set to 0 to disable, or set to desired limit)
maxsequence = 0

# Disable user/gecos check
# Prevents passwords containing username or GECOS fields
usercheck = 0

# Enable dictionary check for common words like "password"
# This checks against the system dictionary
dictcheck = 1

# Enable checking if password contains the username
# (reverse of usercheck, but more comprehensive)
usercheck = 0

# Enable checking if password is a palindrome
# (set to 0 to disable)
palindrome = 0

# Note: Additional security measures should be implemented:
# 1. Screen against lists of previously compromised passwords (requires external service)
# 2. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)
# 3. Use risk-based authentication techniques
# 4. Monitor for sequential number strings and patterns
# 5. Disable password hints in application configuration
# 6. Consider implementing passphrase support

# Additional recommendations not covered by pwquality.conf:
# - Implement breach password checking via external services
# - Enable MFA at application/authentication layer
# - Use risk-based authentication (location, device, behavior)
# - Disable password hints in all authentication systems
# - Educate users on creating strong, memorable passphrases
