```plaintext
# /etc/security/pwquality.conf

# Minimum length for subscriber-chosen passwords
minlen = 8

# Maximum length for subscriber-chosen passwords (64 characters or more is recommended)
maxlen = 64

# Allow all printable ASCII characters and spaces
# Unicode characters are also recommended but not enforced here
# (Unicode handling would require additional configuration in the application layer)
# No specific character type requirements (e.g., no mandatory mix of uppercase, lowercase, digits, or symbols)
# No restrictions on consecutive repeated characters

# Enable password blacklist checking (e.g., against common passwords, breached passwords, etc.)
# This requires an external blacklist or integration with a service
# Example: dictcheck = 1 (if a dictionary check is implemented)
dictcheck = 1

# Disallow passwords that are based on the username or service name
usercheck = 1

# Disallow repetitive or sequential characters (e.g., "aaaaaa", "1234abcd")
# This is not explicitly required but can be enabled for additional security
# Example: maxrepeat = 2 (limits consecutive repeated characters)
maxrepeat = 2

# Disallow passwords that are too similar to the old password
# This is not explicitly required but can be enabled for additional security
# Example: difok = 5 (requires at least 5 characters to differ from the old password)
difok = 5

# Rate-limiting for failed authentication attempts is not configured here
# (This should be implemented at the application or system level)

# No arbitrary password expiration or periodic changes
# (Passwords should only be changed if there is evidence of compromise)
``` 

This configuration aligns with the provided password policy rules, emphasizing length, blacklist checks, and avoiding unnecessary complexity requirements. Note that some aspects, such as Unicode handling and rate-limiting, are application-specific and would need to be implemented separately.
