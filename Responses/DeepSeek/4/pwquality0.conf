# Note: Additional security measures required by NIST:
# 1. Password blacklist checking for compromised passwords MUST be implemented
# 2. Rate limiting for authentication attempts MUST be implemented
# 3. Password strength meters SHOULD be provided
# 4. Unicode normalization SHOULD be applied if Unicode characters are accepted
# 5. Password hints MUST NOT be stored or prompted for
