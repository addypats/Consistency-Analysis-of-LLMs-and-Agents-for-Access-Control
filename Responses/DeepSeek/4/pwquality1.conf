# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
# Password policy configuration based on NIST SP 800-63B guidelines

# Minimum password length for user-chosen passwords
minlen = 8

# Maximum password length (should allow at least 64 characters)
maxlen = 64

# Allow all printable ASCII characters including space
# Note: pwquality doesn't have a direct setting for "allow all ASCII characters"
# The default character classes are already quite permissive

# Disable character class requirements (no forced mixtures)
minclass = 0

# Disable consecutive character restrictions
maxrepeat = 0

# Disable sequence checking
maxsequence = 0

# Enable dictionary check (for common passwords, dictionary words, etc.)
dictcheck = 1

# Enable user check (prevents passwords containing username)
usercheck = 1

# Enable enforcing for root
enforcing = 1

# Retry prompt before returning with error
retry = 3

# Disable palindrome checking
palindrome = 0

# Disable checking for user's name in GECOS field
gecoscheck = 0

# Disable checking for words from passwd entry
passwdqc = 0

# Disable checking for similar passwords
similar = deny

# Note: pwquality.conf doesn't support Unicode normalization or 
# checking against breach corpuses directly. These would need to be
# implemented at the application level.

# Note: Rate limiting and password change policies are not configured
# in pwquality.conf - these must be implemented separately in the
# authentication system (PAM configuration, application logic, etc.)
