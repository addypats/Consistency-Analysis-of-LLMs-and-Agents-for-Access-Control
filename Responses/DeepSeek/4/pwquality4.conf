# Note: This configuration implements the NIST SP 800-63B guidelines which:
# 1. Require minimum 8 characters for user-chosen passwords
# 2. Allow up to 64 characters
# 3. Do not impose arbitrary composition rules
# 4. Check against dictionary/blacklisted passwords
# 5. Check for username in password
# 6. Do not require periodic password changes
#
# Additional measures needed beyond this file:
# - Implement rate limiting for authentication attempts
# - Maintain and check against updated password blacklists
# - Provide password strength feedback to users
# - Force password change only on evidence of compromise
