# Additional security notes:
# - Account lockout policy (8.1.6, 8.3.4) should be configured in PAM
# - Session timeout (8.1.8) should be configured in /etc/profile or shell config
# - MFA requirements (8.4.1 to 8.5.1) require additional authentication modules
# - First-time password reset (8.2.6) should be enforced by application logic
# - Hardcoded password prevention (8.6.2, 8.6.3) requires code review processes
