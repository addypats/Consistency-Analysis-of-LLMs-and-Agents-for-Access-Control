### Explanation:
- **minlen = 12**: Minimum password length of 12 characters.
- **minclass = 2**: Require at least 2 different character classes (e.g., numeric and alphabetic).
- **dcredit = -1**: Require at least 1 digit.
- **ucredit = -1**: Require at least 1 uppercase letter.
- **lcredit = -1**: Require at least 1 lowercase letter.
- **ocredit = -1**: Require at least 1 special character.
- **maxrepeat = 2**: Allow no more than 2 repeated characters.
- **maxsequence = 3**: Allow no more than 3 characters in sequence (e.g., "123").
- **maxclassrepeat = 2**: Allow no more than 2 characters from the same class in a row.
- **gecoscheck = 1**: Check if the password contains the user's GECOS information.
- **dictcheck = 1**: Check if the password is based on a dictionary word.
- **usercheck = 1**: Check if the password contains the username.
- **enforcing = 1**: Enforce password quality rules.
- **retry = 3**: Allow 3 retries before locking out the user.
- **difok = 4**: Require at least 4 characters different from the old password.
- **remember = 4**: Remember the last 4 passwords to prevent reuse.

This configuration enforces strong password policies, including complexity, length, and reuse restrictions, while also addressing lockout and retry mechanisms.
