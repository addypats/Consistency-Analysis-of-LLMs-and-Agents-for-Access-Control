# Password change delay (5.1.4)
# Enforce minimum 1 day between password changes
# Note: This requires PAM configuration in /etc/pam.d/system-auth

# Account lockout settings (5.1.6)
# Temporary lockout after 5 consecutive failed attempts

# even_deny_root
# root_unlock_time=900

# Password expiration (5.1.3)
# Annual expiration as backstop
# Note: Configure in /etc/login.defs:

# PASS_WARN_AGE 7

# Additional notes for system administrators:
# 1. MFA should be enabled wherever possible (2.1)
# 2. Session timeout (5.1.5): Configure in /etc/profile or shell profiles:
#    export TMOUT=900 (15 minutes)
# 3. Account suspension after 45 days inactivity (5.1.8): Use chage or useradd defaults
# 4. Login monitoring and alerts (5.1.7): Implement via auditd or monitoring tools
# 5. Password hints (5.1.9): Disable in authentication system configuration
# 6. Time doubling throttling and permanent lockout after 12 retries (5.1.6):
