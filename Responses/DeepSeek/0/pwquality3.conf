# Special characters allowed
# Note: The system may have additional restrictions on allowed special characters
# The following are typically safe: !@#$%^&*_+=?/~';,<>|\
# This is enforced by the ocredit setting above

# Password history (cannot reuse for 1 year) - Note: This is set in /etc/pam.d/common-password
# Add "remember=12" to the pam_unix.so line in /etc/pam.d/common-password
# This remembers 12 previous passwords (12 months if changing every 30 days)

# Additional security settings
# Reject passwords that contain long monotonic character sequences
maxsequence = 3

# The following settings help prevent passwords tied to personal information:
# - usercheck prevents usernames
# - gecoscheck prevents GECOS field information (full name, room number, etc.)
# - dictcheck prevents dictionary words
# Additional personal information should be filtered at organizational policy level
