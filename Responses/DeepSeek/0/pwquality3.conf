# Require at least one uppercase letter

# Require at least one lowercase letter

# Require at least one special character
ocredit = -1

# Prevent the use of dictionary words
dictcheck = 1

# Prevent the use of passwords based on the username

# Prevent the use of passwords based on common patterns

# Password aging (90 days)
# Note: This setting is typically configured in /etc/login.defs or /etc/shadow, not pwquality.conf
# PASS_MAX_DAYS = 90

# Password reuse (1 year)
# Note: This setting is typically configured in /etc/pam.d/common-password or /etc/security/opasswd

``` 

**Note:** Password aging (`PASS_MAX_DAYS`) and password reuse (`remember`) are typically configured in other files like `/etc/login.defs`, `/etc/shadow`, or `/etc/pam.d/common-password`. The `pwquality.conf` file primarily handles password complexity rules.
