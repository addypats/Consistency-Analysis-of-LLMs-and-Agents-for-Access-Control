# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
# Password quality configuration

# Password aging (90 days) - Note: This is set in /etc/login.defs, not pwquality.conf
# Set PASS_MAX_DAYS 90 in /etc/login.defs

# Minimum password length
minlen = 10

# Character class requirements
minclass = 3
dcredit = -1
ucredit = -1
lcredit = -1
ocredit = -1

# Special characters allowed (as permitted by the system)
# Note: pwquality uses a different syntax for special characters
# The system's default special characters are typically: !@#$%^&*()-_+=?/<>,.:;'"\|[]{}`

# Dictionary words check
dictcheck = 1
dictpath = /usr/share/dict/words

# Username similarity check
usercheck = 1

# Password history (1 year) - Note: This is set in /etc/pam.d/common-password
# Add "remember=12" to the pam_unix.so line in /etc/pam.d/common-password
# to remember 12 previous passwords (12 months at 30-day changes)

# Additional security settings
maxrepeat = 2
maxsequence = 3
maxclassrepeat = 2

# Check for palindrome
palindrome = 1

# Check for monotonic sequences
monothonic = 1

# Additional notes:
# 1. To enforce 90-day password changes, edit /etc/login.defs and set:
#    PASS_MAX_DAYS 90
#
# 2. To enforce 1-year password history, edit /etc/pam.d/common-password and add:
#    remember=12 to the pam_unix.so line
#
# 3. The system automatically prevents dictionary words through dictcheck=1
#
# 4. The system prevents passwords similar to username through usercheck=1
#
# 5. The minclass=3 ensures at least 3 of these 4 character classes:
#    - lowercase letters (lcredit)
#    - uppercase letters (ucredit)
#    - digits (dcredit)
#    - special characters (ocredit)
