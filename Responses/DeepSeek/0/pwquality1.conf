# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
# Password quality configuration

# Password aging (90 days) - Note: This is configured in /etc/login.defs, not here
# Set PASS_MAX_DAYS 90 in /etc/login.defs

# Minimum password length
minlen = 10

# Password complexity requirements
# Require at least one digit
dcredit = -1
# Require at least one uppercase character
ucredit = -1
# Require at least one lowercase character
lcredit = -1
# Require at least one other (special) character
ocredit = -1

# Special characters allowed (as permitted by the system)
# Note: The actual allowed characters depend on system configuration
# The following are commonly permitted special characters:
# ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ + = ? / ~ ' ; , < > | \

# Dictionary check - prevent dictionary words
dictcheck = 1

# User check - prevent similarity to username
usercheck = 1

# Maximum sequence length of same characters
maxrepeat = 2

# Maximum sequence length of consecutive characters
maxsequence = 3

# Maximum number of consecutive same class characters
maxclassrepeat = 2

# Password history (1 year) - Note: This is configured elsewhere
# Set remember=12 in /etc/pam.d/common-password for 12 previous passwords
# or use password history in /etc/security/opasswd

# Additional notes for system administrators:
# 1. To enforce 90-day password rotation, edit /etc/login.defs:
#    PASS_MAX_DAYS 90
#
# 2. To enforce 1-year password history (prevent reuse), configure PAM:
#    In /etc/pam.d/common-password, add: remember=12
#
# 3. The system cannot automatically check for personal information
#    (SSN, birth dates, relatives' names). This requires user education
#    and manual policy enforcement.
#
# 4. Dictionary checking uses cracklib dictionaries. Ensure they are installed:
#    apt-get install libcrack2 (Debian/Ubuntu)
#    yum install cracklib (RHEL/CentOS)
