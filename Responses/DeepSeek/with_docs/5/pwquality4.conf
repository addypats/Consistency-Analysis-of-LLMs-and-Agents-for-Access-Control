### Explanation of the settings:
- **minlen = 12**: Minimum password length of 12 characters.
- **minclass = 2**: Require at least 2 character classes (e.g., numeric and alphabetic).
- **dcredit = -1**: Require at least one digit.
- **ucredit = -1**: Require at least one uppercase letter.
- **lcredit = -1**: Require at least one lowercase letter.
- **ocredit = -1**: Require at least one special character.
- **maxrepeat = 3**: Maximum number of allowed consecutive repeated characters.
- **maxsequence = 3**: Maximum length of monotonic character sequences.
- **maxclassrepeat = 4**: Maximum number of allowed consecutive characters of the same class.
- **gecoscheck = 1**: Check if the password contains words from the user's GECOS field.
- **dictcheck = 1**: Check if the password is based on a dictionary word.
- **usercheck = 1**: Check if the password contains the username.
- **enforcing = 1**: Enforce password quality rules.
- **retry = 3**: Number of retries allowed before returning an error.
- **difok = 4**: Number of characters that must be different from the old password.
- **remember = 4**: Remember the last 4 passwords to prevent reuse.
- **enforce_for_root = 1**: Enforce password quality rules for the root user.
- **local_users_only = 1**: Apply rules only to local users.

This configuration enforces strong password policies, including complexity, length, and reuse restrictions, while also ensuring compliance with the provided security requirements.
