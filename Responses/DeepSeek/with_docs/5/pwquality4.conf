# Additional security notes:
# - Account lockout after 6 attempts (8.1.6) should be configured in /etc/security/faillock.conf or PAM
# - Lockout duration of 30 minutes (8.1.7, 8.3.4) should be configured in /etc/security/faillock.conf
# - Session timeout of 15 minutes (8.1.8) should be configured in /etc/profile or shell configuration
# - Password expiration of 90 days (8.2.4) should be configured in /etc/login.defs
# - First-time password reset (8.2.6) should be implemented through account management procedures
# - MFA requirements (8.4.1 to 8.5.1) should be implemented through PAM and system configuration
# - Password encryption in transit/storage (8.3.1) should be configured in service configurations
# - Password compromise procedures (8.3.8) should be documented in security policies
# - Hardcoded password prevention (8.6.2, 8.6.3) should be enforced through code review and scanning tools
