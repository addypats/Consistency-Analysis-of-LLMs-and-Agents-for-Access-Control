### Explanation of Settings:
- **minlen = 12**: Minimum password length of 12 characters.
- **minclass = 2**: Passwords must contain at least 2 different character classes (e.g., numeric and alphabetic).
- **dcredit = -1**: Passwords must contain at least one digit.
- **ucredit = -1**: Passwords must contain at least one uppercase letter.
- **lcredit = -1**: Passwords must contain at least one lowercase letter.
- **ocredit = -1**: Passwords must contain at least one special character.
- **maxrepeat = 3**: Passwords cannot contain more than 3 repeated characters.
- **maxsequence = 3**: Passwords cannot contain more than 3 characters in sequence (e.g., "123" or "abc").
- **maxclassrepeat = 2**: Passwords cannot contain more than 2 characters from the same class in a row.
- **gecoscheck = 1**: Passwords cannot contain the user's GECOS (full name) information.
- **dictcheck = 1**: Passwords cannot be based on dictionary words.
- **usercheck = 1**: Passwords cannot contain the username.
- **enforcing = 1**: Enforce password quality rules.
- **retry = 3**: Allow 3 retries for entering a valid password.
- **difok = 4**: New passwords must differ by at least 4 characters from the old password.
- **remember = 4**: Remember the last 4 passwords to prevent reuse.
- **enforce_for_root = 1**: Enforce password rules for the root user.
- **local_users_only = 1**: Only enforce rules for local users.

### Notes:
- The settings above align with the requirements provided, such as minimum password length, complexity, and reuse restrictions.
- Additional system-level configurations (e.g., account lockout, session timeout, MFA) are typically managed outside of `pwquality.conf` (e.g., in PAM or system settings).
