# Note: MFA-specific settings (minlen = 8) would need to be configured
# through alternative mechanisms as pwquality.conf doesn't support
# conditional policies based on MFA status

# Additional notes for system administrators:
# - MFA-specific password length (8 chars) must be enforced through PAM configuration
# - Maximum password length is not limited by this configuration
# - Password expiration and rotation policies must be configured in /etc/login.defs
# - Account lockout policies must be configured through PAM (pam_faillock)
# - Session timeout must be configured through PAM or display manager
# - Account suspension after inactivity must be configured through system tools
# - Password hints should be disabled in application configurations
# - Monitoring and alerting must be configured through system monitoring tools
