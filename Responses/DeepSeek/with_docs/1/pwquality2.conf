# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
# Password quality configuration file
# Generated according to NIST SP 800-63B guidelines

# Minimum password length (8 characters minimum)
minlen = 8

# Maximum password length (allow passphrases up to 64 characters)
# Note: pwquality doesn't have a maxlen parameter, but systems should support up to 64 chars
# maxlen = 64

# Disable composition rules - no longer required per NIST guidelines
# This allows users to create passwords without forced complexity requirements
minclass = 0
maxclassrepeat = 0

# Disable sequential character checks (e.g., "12345", "abcde")
# Note: pwquality doesn't have direct sequential checking, but we disable similar checks
maxsequence = 0

# Disable consecutive same character checks (e.g., "aaaaaa")
maxrepeat = 0

# Disable palindrome checking
palindrome = 0

# Disable dictionary word checking (to be handled by external breach checking systems)
dictcheck = 0
usercheck = 0

# Disable username checking (to be handled by external systems)
usercheck = 0

# Disable gecko checking (similar characters like 0 and O)
gecoscheck = 0

# Additional notes for system administrators:
# 1. Implement external breach password checking (e.g., HaveIBeenPwned API integration)
# 2. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all accounts
# 3. Implement risk-based authentication techniques
# 4. Monitor for common passwords like "password", "123456", etc.
# 5. Do not use password hints
# 6. Support passphrases up to 64 characters
# 7. Screen against previously compromised passwords
# 8. Consider 15+ characters as recommended length for better security

# Note: pwquality.conf has limitations in implementing all NIST recommendations.
# Additional security measures should be implemented at the application level.
