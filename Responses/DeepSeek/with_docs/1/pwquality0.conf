### Explanation:
- **`minlen = 8`**: Passwords must be at least 8 characters long.
- **`minclass = 0`**: No specific character class requirements (e.g., no mandatory special characters).
- **`maxrepeat = 2`**: Limit consecutive repeated characters to 2.
- **`maxsequence = 3`**: Limit sequential characters (e.g., "123") to 3.
- **`maxclassrepeat = 3`**: Limit repeated characters from the same class (e.g., "aaa") to 3.
- **`dictcheck = 1`**: Check passwords against a dictionary of common words.
- **`badwords`**: List of common words to reject.
- **`maxlen = 64`**: Allow passphrases up to 64 characters.
- **`enforce_for_root = 1`**: Apply these rules to the root user as well.

This configuration aligns with the provided policy rules, emphasizing length over complexity and rejecting compromised or weak passwords.
