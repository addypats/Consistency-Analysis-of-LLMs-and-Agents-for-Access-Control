# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
# Password quality configuration based on NIST SP 800-63B guidelines

# Minimum password length (NIST recommends at least 8 characters)
minlen = 8

# Maximum password length (NIST recommends allowing up to 64 characters)
maxlen = 64

# Disable composition rules (NIST no longer recommends requiring special characters)
# This allows users to create passphrases without forced complexity
minclass = 0

# Disable consecutive identical characters check
maxrepeat = 0

# Disable sequential character checks (e.g., "12345", "abcde")
maxsequence = 0

# Disable palindrome checking
palindrome = 0

# Disable user/gecos check (don't check password against user information)
usercheck = 0

# Disable dictionary word check (this should be handled by external breach checking)
dictcheck = 0

# Note: The following policies should be implemented at the application level:
# 1. Screening against lists of previously compromised passwords
# 2. Monitoring for obvious security weaknesses (common words, sequential strings)
# 3. Multi-factor authentication implementation
# 4. Risk-based authentication techniques
# 5. Disabling password hints

# Additional recommendations for application-level implementation:
# - Implement breach password checking using services like HaveIBeenPwned
# - Implement MFA for all user accounts
# - Use risk-based authentication to prompt for additional verification
# - Educate users about creating strong passphrases instead of complex passwords
