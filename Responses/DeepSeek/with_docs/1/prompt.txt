Generate me a /etc/security/pwquality.conf file with the following password policy rules (reply with just the contents of the file):
Passwords must be at least eight characters in length and should be at least 15 characters in length.
Authenticators should monitor newly registered passwords for obvious security weaknesses, like sequential number strings and common words like “password”.
Authenticators should screen new passwords against lists of previously compromised passwords and reject those that have already been breached.
Organizations should not use password hints, since these can provide hackers important clues.
Composition rules for including special characters are no longer required, since these often lead to predictable passwords.
Long passwords are encouraged over complex ones. NIST recommends enabling passphrases of up to 64 characters.
Password-based authentication should be enhanced with multi-factor authentication, and risk-based authentication techniques should be used whenever possible.
