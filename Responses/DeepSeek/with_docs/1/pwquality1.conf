# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
# Password policy configuration based on NIST SP 800-63B guidelines

# Minimum password length (8 characters as per NIST)
minlen = 8

# Maximum password length (64 characters as per NIST for passphrases)
maxlen = 64

# Disable composition rules - no longer required per NIST
# (Not setting minclass, maxclass, maxrepeat, maxsequence, etc.)

# Disable password hints - not used per policy
# (This is typically configured in application settings, not pwquality.conf)

# Note: The following policies are not configurable in pwquality.conf
# and must be implemented at the application/authentication system level:
# 1. Screening against previously compromised passwords
# 2. Monitoring for sequential number strings and common words
# 3. Multi-factor authentication requirements
# 4. Risk-based authentication techniques

# Additional recommendations (configure in application layer):
# - Implement password breach checking (Have I Been Pwned API or similar)
# - Implement MFA for all password-based authentication
# - Use risk-based authentication where possible
# - Allow passphrases up to 64 characters
# - Reject common dictionary words and patterns
