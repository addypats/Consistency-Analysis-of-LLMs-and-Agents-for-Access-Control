### Explanation:
- **minlen = 8**: Passwords must be at least 8 characters long.
- **minclass = 0**: No specific character class requirements (e.g., no mandatory special characters).
- **maxrepeat = 3**: Reject passwords with more than 3 repeated characters.
- **maxsequence = 3**: Reject passwords with more than 3 sequential characters (e.g., "1234").
- **dictcheck = 1**: Check passwords against a dictionary of common words.
- **hints = 0**: Disable password hints.
- **dcredit = 0, ucredit = 0, lcredit = 0, ocredit = 0**: No credit for digits, uppercase, lowercase, or special characters (no complexity requirements).
- **maxlen = 64**: Allow passwords up to 64 characters long.
- **passphrase = 1**: Enable passphrases.
- **badwords**: Reject common words like "password" and sequential strings like "123456".
- **enforce_for_root = 1**: Apply these rules to the root user as well.
