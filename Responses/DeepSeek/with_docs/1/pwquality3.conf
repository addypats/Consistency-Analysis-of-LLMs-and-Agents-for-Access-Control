# Note: The following should be implemented at application level:
# 1. Password screening against breached password databases
# 2. Rejection of common passwords (like "password")
# 3. Multi-factor authentication
# 4. Risk-based authentication
# 5. No password hints
# 6. Monitoring for sequential number strings and patterns

# Additional recommendations for application implementation:
# - Screen against known compromised passwords
# - Implement MFA for all password-based authentication
# - Use risk-based authentication techniques
# - Allow passphrases up to 64 characters
# - Reject passwords containing dictionary words in context checks
