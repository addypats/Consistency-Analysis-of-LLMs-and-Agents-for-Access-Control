# Password aging - 90 days (enforced via /etc/login.defs, not pwquality.conf)
# Note: Password aging is configured in /etc/login.defs with PASS_MAX_DAYS 90

# Minimum password length
minlen = 10

# Password complexity requirements
# Require at least one digit (dcredit)
dcredit = -1
# Require at least one uppercase character (ucredit)
ucredit = -1
# Require at least one lowercase character (lcredit)
lcredit = -1
# Require at least one other (special) character (ocredit)
ocredit = -1

# Special characters allowed (as specified in policy)
# Note: pwquality uses a default set, but we can specify additional ones if needed
# The policy specifies: !@#$%^&*_+=?/~';',<>|\
# Note: Some characters may need escaping or may conflict with shell/parser
# The actual implementation may vary by system

# Dictionary check - prevent dictionary words
dictcheck = 1
# Check if it's a dictionary word
dictpath = /usr/share/dict/words

# Username check - prevent passwords containing username
usercheck = 1

# Check for palindrome
palindrome = 1

# Maximum number of consecutive identical characters
maxrepeat = 3

# Maximum number of consecutive characters of same class
maxclassrepeat = 4

# Minimum number of character classes required (lower, upper, digit, other)
minclass = 4

# Check for geometric patterns on keyboard
gecoscheck = 1

# Check against previous passwords (requires pam_pwhistory)
# Note: Password history (1 year) is configured via pam_pwhistory or /etc/security/opasswd
# This would typically be in /etc/pam.d/common-password or similar PAM configuration

# Additional notes for system administrators:
# 1. Password aging (90 days) must be configured in /etc/login.defs:
#    PASS_MAX_DAYS 90
#
# 2. Password history (1 year/no reuse) requires PAM configuration:
#    In /etc/pam.d/common-password or similar, add:
#    password required pam_pwhistory.so remember=4 use_authtok
#    (assuming 90-day rotation, 4 previous passwords = 1 year)
#
# 3. Dictionary word prevention may require additional dictionary files
#
# 4. The "not easily tied back to account owner" requirement is partially
#    addressed by usercheck=1 and gecoscheck=1, but requires user education
#
# 5. Special character set enforcement may require custom PAM modules
#    as pwquality has limited configuration for specific character sets
