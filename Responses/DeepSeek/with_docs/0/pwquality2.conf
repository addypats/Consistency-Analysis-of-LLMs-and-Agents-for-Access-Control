# Additional notes for system administrators:
# 1. To enforce 90-day password expiration, set in /etc/login.defs:
#    PASS_MAX_DAYS 90
#    PASS_MIN_DAYS 1
#    PASS_WARN_AGE 7
#
# 2. To enforce password history (1 year/4 previous passwords), configure PAM:
#    In /etc/pam.d/system-auth or /etc/pam.d/common-password, add:
#    password required pam_unix.so remember=4 use_authtok
#
# 3. The system should also enforce:
#    - No passwords containing personal information (SSN, birth dates, etc.)
#    - This requires user education and potentially additional monitoring
#    - No acronyms (partially covered by dictcheck and sequence checks)
#
