# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
# Password quality configuration file
# Generated according to specified policy requirements

# Password aging - 90 days (enforced via /etc/login.defs or PAM)
# Note: Password aging is typically configured in /etc/login.defs, not here

# Minimum password length
minlen = 10

# Password complexity requirements
# Require at least one digit
dcredit = -1
# Require at least one uppercase character
ucredit = -1
# Require at least one lowercase character
lcredit = -1
# Require at least one other (special) character
ocredit = -1

# Special characters allowed (as specified in policy)
# Note: pwquality uses a different syntax for allowed characters
# The policy characters: !@#$%^&*_+=?/~';',<>|\
# We'll configure the allowed special characters
# Note: pwquality doesn't have a direct "allowed special chars" setting
# but we can use the 'badwords' to prevent unwanted patterns

# Prevent passwords containing username
usercheck = 1

# Dictionary check - prevent dictionary words
dictcheck = 1

# Maximum sequence length - prevent sequential characters
maxsequence = 3

# Maximum repeat count - prevent repeated characters
maxrepeat = 2

# Check for palindrome
palindrome = 1

# Additional notes:
# 1. Password reuse policy (1 year) must be configured in PAM's pam_unix.so or pam_pwhistory.so
#    Add to PAM configuration: remember=12 (for 12 previous passwords)
#
# 2. Password aging (90 days) must be configured in /etc/login.defs:
#    PASS_MAX_DAYS 90
#
# 3. The policy prohibiting personal information (SSN, names, birth dates, etc.)
#    requires additional custom dictionary checks or user education
#
# 4. For the complete special character set, ensure PAM configuration
#    doesn't restrict the allowed characters beyond what's in the policy
