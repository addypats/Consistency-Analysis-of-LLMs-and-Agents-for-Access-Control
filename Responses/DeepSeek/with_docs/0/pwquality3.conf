# Note: Password reuse policy (1 year) is typically configured in PAM
# For RHEL/CentOS/Fedora, this is configured in:
# /etc/pam.d/system-auth or /etc/pam.d/password-auth
# using the 'remember' option for pam_unix or pam_pwhistory

# Example PAM configuration for password history (add to appropriate PAM file):
# password    required    pam_pwhistory.so remember=12 use_authtok

# Note: Password aging (90 days) is configured in /etc/login.defs:
# PASS_MAX_DAYS 90
# PASS_MIN_DAYS 1
# PASS_WARN_AGE 7
