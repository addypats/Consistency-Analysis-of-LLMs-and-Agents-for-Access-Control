# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
# Password quality configuration file

# Password aging - must be changed every 90 days (configured in /etc/login.defs)
# PASS_MAX_DAYS 90 should be set in /etc/login.defs

# Minimum password length

# Password complexity requirements
# Require at least one digit (dcredit)
dcredit = -1
# Require at least one uppercase character (ucredit)
ucredit = -1
# Require at least one lowercase character (lcredit)

# Require at least one other (special) character (ocredit)
ocredit = -1

# Define allowed special characters
# Note: pwquality uses a different syntax for allowed characters
# The following characters are permitted: !@#$%^&*_+=?/~';,<>|\
# (Note: pwquality doesn't have a direct "allowed characters" setting,
# but these are standard special characters it recognizes)

# Prevent passwords containing username

# Dictionary check - prevent dictionary words

# Maximum number of consecutive identical characters
maxrepeat = 2

# Maximum number of consecutive characters of same class

# Check for palindrome
palindrome = 1

# Check for monotonic sequences

# Check for geometric sequences

# Additional notes for system administrators:
# 1. Password history (cannot be reused for 1 year) should be configured in PAM:
#    Add "remember=12" to the pam_unix.so line in /etc/pam.d/common-password
#    (12 months * 30 days = 360 days, approximating 1 year)
#
# 2. Password aging (90 days) should be configured in /etc/login.defs:
#    PASS_MAX_DAYS 90
#    PASS_MIN_DAYS 1
#    PASS_WARN_AGE 7
#
# 3. The policy preventing passwords tied to account owner (SSN, nickname, etc.)
#    requires additional user education and potentially custom PAM modules,
#    as pwquality doesn't have built-in checks for these specific patterns.
#
# 4. Dictionary check uses the system dictionary; ensure /usr/share/dict/words
#    is installed or configure dictpath to point to appropriate dictionary files.
