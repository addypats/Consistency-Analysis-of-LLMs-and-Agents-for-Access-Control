#
# Password Quality Policy Rules:
#
# 1. Password Expiration:
#    - All passwords must be changed at least every 90 days.
#      (Note: Expiration policies like PASS_MAX_DAYS are typically set
#       in /etc/login.defs or via the shadow file, not enforced by
#       pwquality.)
#
# 2. Password Sharing and Storage:
#    - Do not insert passwords into email or other electronic communications.
#    - Do not share passwords with anyone (including via email or phone).
#    - Do not write passwords down or store them electronically without encryption.
#
# 3. Complexity Requirements:
#    - Passwords must be at least 8 characters long.
#    - They must contain at least 1 alphabetic character and 1 numeric character.
#    - Passwords should not be based on a dictionary word.
#    - Passwords must not include your name or username.
#
# 4. Password Change Frequency:
#    - You can only change your password once every two days.
#      (Note: This policy is generally enforced via account management
#       settings such as PASS_MIN_DAYS, not directly through pwquality.)
#
# The following parameters are enforced by pam_pwquality:
minlen = 8
# dcredit requires at least 1 digit (negative value means the number of
# required digits, so -1 forces at least one numeric character)
dcredit = -1

# Enforce a minimum number of different character classes. This helps
# ensure that at least one alphabetic character is present along with digits.
minclass = 2

# Use dictionary check to reject passwords based on dictionary words.
dictcheck = 1

# Prevent using the username as part of the password.
reject_username = 1

# Note:
# The settings for password expiration (e.g., maximum age of 90 days)
# and minimum days between password changes (2 days) are not handled
# by this file. They should be configured in /etc/login.defs or equivalent.
