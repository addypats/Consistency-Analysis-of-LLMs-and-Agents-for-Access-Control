# Password Policy Rules:
#
# 1. All passwords must be changed at least every 90 days.
#    (Note: Enforce using system password aging settings, e.g., in /etc/login.defs or via chage.)
#
# 2. Passwords must not be inserted into email messages or other forms of electronic communication,
#    and should not be shared with anyone (including via email or phone).
#
# 3. Passwords should never be written down or stored electronically without proper encryption.
#
# 4. All passwords must:
#    - Be at least 8 characters long.
#    - Contain at least 1 alphabetic character and 1 numeric character.
#    - Not be based on a dictionary word.
#    - Not include parts of your name or user name.
#
# 5. Passwords may only be changed once every two days.
#    (Note: Enforce this via system settings such as login.defs or PAM modules that control change frequency.)
#
# The settings below enforce the minimum length and character composition requirements.
minlen = 8
dcredit = -1        # Require at least one digit.
minclass = 2        # Must use at least two character classes (e.g., letter and digit).
dictcheck = 1       # Enable dictionary word check.
