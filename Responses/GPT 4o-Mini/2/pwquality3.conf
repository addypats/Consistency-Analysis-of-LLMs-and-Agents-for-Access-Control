# This file defines password quality requirements.

# NOTE: Several of the required policy rules (such as mandatory expiration every 90 days,
# prohibition of password sharing via electronic communication, secure storage, and a minimum
# interval between password changes) must be enforced by other system policies and tools.
#
# Minimum password length: at least 8 characters
minlen = 8

# Require at least one digit.
# The value -1 means that one digit is required.
dcredit = -1

# Require at least one alphabetic (lowercase) character.
# Using lcredit = -1 ensures that at least one lowercase letter must be present.
lcredit = -1

# No explicit requirement for uppercase letters.
ucredit = 0

# Ensure that passwords are not simple dictionary words.
dictcheck = 1

# Reject password if it contains the user name.
reject_username = 1
