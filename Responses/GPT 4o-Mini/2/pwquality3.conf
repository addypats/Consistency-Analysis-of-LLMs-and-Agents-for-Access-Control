# Password Policy Guidelines:
#
# 1. All passwords must be changed at least every 90 days.
#    (Note: This requirement is enforced via system aging and account management settings.)
#
# 2. Do not insert passwords into email messages or other electronic communications,
#    and never share them with anyone.
#
# 3. Do not write down or electronically store passwords in plain text;
#    use encryption if they must be stored.
#
# 4. Passwords must be at least 8 characters long, contain at least one alpha character
#    and one numeric digit, should not be a dictionary word, and must not contain your name or username.
#
# 5. Password changes are allowed no more frequently than once every two days.
#    (Note: This is typically enforced via account aging settings.)
