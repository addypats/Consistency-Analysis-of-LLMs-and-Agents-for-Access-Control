# Password policy guidelines (for administrative reference):
# - All passwords must be changed at least every 90 days.
# - Passwords must not be sent via email or any other electronic communication.
# - Passwords should not be written down or stored electronically without encryption.
# - Passwords must not be based on a dictionary word or include your name/username.
# - You can only change your password once every two days.
#
# Note: Some of these policies (e.g., expiration and change frequency)
# must be enforced by other system settings (such as PAM or /etc/login.defs)
# and are not directly configurable via pwquality.
#
# Enforce a minimum password length of 8 characters.
minlen = 8
#
# Enforce at least one digit.
dcredit = -1
#
# Enforce at least one alphabetic character.
lcredit = -1
#
# Enable dictionary word checking.
dictcheck = 1

# Additional organizational notes (to be enforced via complementary system settings):
# password_expiration_days = 90
# min_days_between_changes = 2
