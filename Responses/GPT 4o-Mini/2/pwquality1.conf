# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This configuration file is used to enforce password complexity requirements.
#
# Note: Certain password policies—such as password aging (must change every 90 days)
# and restrictions on how often passwords may be changed (only once every two days),
# as well as rules regarding email or other non-secure sharing and storage—
# cannot be enforced via this file. Those settings should be implemented through
# other system configuration files and user education.
#
# Enforced rules via this file:
#
# • Passwords must be at least 8 characters long.
# • Passwords must include at least 1 numeric character.
# • Passwords must include at least 1 alphabetic character.
# • Passwords must not be based on a dictionary word.
# • Passwords must not contain the user name.
#

dictcheck = 1     # Enable dictionary word check
reject_username = 1  # Disallow passwords containing the username
