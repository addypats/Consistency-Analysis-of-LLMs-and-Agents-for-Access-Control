# Password Policy Guidelines:
#
# 1. All passwords (e.g., email, web, computer, etc.) must be changed at least every 90 days.
# 2. Passwords must not be inserted into email messages or any other form of electronic communication.
#    They should not be shared with anyone, including via email or phone conversations.
# 3. Passwords should not be written down or stored electronically without encryption.
# 4. All passwords must:
#      - Be at least 8 characters long
#      - Contain at least 1 alphabetic and 1 numeric character
#      - Not be based on dictionary words (dictcheck is enabled)
#      - Not be part of your name or username (reject_username is enabled)
# 5. You can only change your password once every two days.
#
# Note:
# The configuration below enforces parameters for password composition.
# Additional policies (e.g., password aging rules, restrictions on change frequency,
# and prohibiting storage or transmission of passwords by insecure means)
# must be implemented using other system tools (such as /etc/login.defs, PAM modules, or organizational policy).
