#
# Password Quality Settings Based on the Organization's Policy:
#
# 1. Passwords must be at least 8 characters, but organizations are
#    strongly encouraged to use passphrases of at least 15 characters.
#    NIST even recommends supporting passphrases up to 64 characters.
minlen = 15
#
# 2. Enable dictionary and sequence checking to monitor against obvious
#    weaknesses such as sequential numbers or common words like "password".
#
#    The "dictcheck" option causes the module to examine the new password
#    against words in the specified dictionary. Adjust the dictpath if needed.
dictcheck = 1
# dictpath = /usr/share/dict/words
#
# 3. Although screening against previously compromised passwords
#    (e.g., via integration with an external breach database) isn’t handled
#    directly here, ensure your authenticator or password manager implements
#    such a check.
#
# 4. Organizations should not use password hints. (This policy is enforced
#    outside of pwquality and should be managed by your authentication system.)
#
# 5. Composition rules (forcing special characters, digits, upper/lowercase)
#    are no longer required here as they often lead to predictable patterns.
#    Hence, we do not set or enforce credit parameters for character classes.
#
# 6. While complexity requirements are relaxed, longer passwords are encouraged.
#    This file’s settings favor passphrases over complex, punctuation-heavy passwords.
#
# 7. Authentication enhancements such as multi-factor and risk-based
#    authentication are beyond the scope of pwquality.conf and should be
#    implemented in your overall security architecture.
#
# 8. Limit repeated characters to avoid patterns (this may also help catch
#    sequential or repetitive string use).
maxrepeat = 0
