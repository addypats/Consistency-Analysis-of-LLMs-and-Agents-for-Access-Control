# Note:
# - Screening new passwords against lists of previously compromised passwords
#   is encouraged. This integration may require an external tool or service
#   as it is not natively provided by pwquality.
#
# - Password hints should not be used, as they can disclose useful clues to an attacker.
#
# - Enhancing password-based authentication with multi-factor authentication and
#   incorporating risk-based techniques should be implemented in the overall PAM
#   configuration and additional security mechanisms.
