# Long passphrases are encouraged – systems should allow passwords up to 64 characters.
# (Note: While pwquality.conf does not limit maximum length, ensure your authentication framework permits up to 64 characters.)

# Disable complexity (composition) requirements.
# Special, uppercase, lowercase, and digit credits are set to 0 so that composition rules are not enforced.

# Enable dictionary checks to screen for common words (e.g., "password")
# and to help catch sequential number strings.

# NOTE:
# • Password hints should not be used as they can provide attackers with important clues.
# • Screening against lists of previously compromised passwords must be performed via additional integrations,
#   as pwquality does not natively support this.
# • Enhancements such as multi-factor authentication and risk-based authentication should be implemented
#   within the overall authentication framework.
