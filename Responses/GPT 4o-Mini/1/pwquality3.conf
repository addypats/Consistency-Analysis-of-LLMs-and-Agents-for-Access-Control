# - The password must be at least 8 characters long (mandatory).
# - Users are strongly encouraged to use passphrases of at least 15 characters.

# (Note: While this file enforces a minimum length of 8, policy guidelines recommend using 15 or more characters.)

# Although additional screening against lists of previously compromised passwords is required by policy,
# pwquality itself does not perform such checks.
# It is recommended to integrate external breach-compromise tools to screen new passwords.

# Composition rules (e.g., forcing special characters) are no longer required.
# Reset credit options to avoid enforcing specific character classes.

# Optional: Limit sequential characters (if supported by your libpwquality version)

#
# Note:
# • This file does not manage password hints. Ensure your overall authentication system does not display or utilize hints.
# • Password-based authentication should be enhanced with multi-factor authentication and risk-based methods.
#   Please configure these separately in your system’s authentication framework.
