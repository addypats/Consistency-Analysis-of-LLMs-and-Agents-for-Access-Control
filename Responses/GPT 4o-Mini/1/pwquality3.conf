# NOTE:
# - Password hints should not be used as they can give away clues to potential attackers.
# - Multi-factor authentication and risk-based authentication are strongly recommended

# - The pwquality module leverages local dictionaries and cracking tools (such as CrackLib)
#   to help identify regex-patterned weaknesses and previously compromised passwords.
