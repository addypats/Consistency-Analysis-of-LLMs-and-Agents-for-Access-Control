# Note:
# • Even though a minimum of eight characters is allowed by some systems, this policy recommends and enforces 15.
# • Screening passwords against lists of previously compromised passwords is expected to be integrated
#   via external tools or PAM modules, and is not configured in this file.
# • Password hints should not be used; their omission here reinforces that practice.
# • Multi-factor and risk-based authentication enhancements are managed in other parts of the authentication stack.
