# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file configures password quality settings in accordance with current policies.
#
# Policy notes:
# • Passwords must be at least eight characters long, but a passphrase length of 15 characters
#   is strongly recommended. (Longer passwords up to 64 characters are allowed.)
# • Newly registered passwords will be checked against common dictionary words (e.g. “password”)
#   and simple sequences (such as sequential numbers) to help avoid obvious weaknesses.
# • New passwords should be screened against lists of previously compromised passwords.
#   (Enforcement of this check may involve integration with external “pwned password” services.)
# • Password hints are not permitted, so no password-hint functionality is provided.
# • Enforcing strict composition requirements (e.g. requiring special characters)
#   is intentionally disabled since they can lead to predictable patterns.
# • Overall, long passphrases are encouraged over forced complexity.
# • Enhance password-based authentication by combining it with multi-factor and risk-based
#   authentication techniques (this falls outside of this configuration file).
#
# Minimum passphrase length:
minlen = 15

# Enable dictionary-based checks to catch common words.
# (Ensure that dictpath points to a file with a list of common words.)
dictcheck = 1
dictpath = /usr/share/dict/words

# Note:
# The default minimum of eight characters is noted in policy, but the recommended
# minimum is set above to 15 characters. Systems enforcing the eight‐character minimum
# as a hard limit while recommending 15 need to ensure proper user education.
#
# Composition checks (credit requirements) have been relaxed to allow long, memorable
# passphrases instead of forcing characters from specific classes.
