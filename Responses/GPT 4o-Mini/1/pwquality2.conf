# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This configuration reinforces a password policy that:
# • Requires passwords to have a minimum length of 15 characters (while still allowing the use of shorter
#   (8+ character) passwords in legacy systems—but new passwords must be at least 15 characters).
# • Warns against obvious weaknesses such as sequential numbers and common words (e.g. "password").
# • Checks new passwords against a dictionary of common words.
# • (When integrated with additional tools) Screens against lists of previously compromised passwords.
# • Avoids enforcing composition rules that mandate specific special characters.
# • Encourages long passphrases (up to 64 characters), as recommended by NIST.
# • Reminds implementers to enhance password-based authentication with multi-factor and risk-based techniques.
#
# Minimum password length is set to 15 characters.
minlen = 15
#
# Maximum allowed password length (passphrases up to 64 characters are permitted).
maxlen = 64
#
# Enable dictionary checks to detect common words (e.g. "password") in the submitted password.
dictcheck = 1
#
# Disable character class credit requirements; composition rules requiring special characters
# are not enforced because they can lead to predictable patterns.
dcredit = 0
ucredit = 0
lcredit = 0
ocredit = 0
#
# Reject passwords that contain sequences that are too predictable.
# Setting maxsequence to 0 means no sequences are allowed.
maxsequence = 0
#
# Disallow any repeated characters in sequence.
maxrepeat = 0
#
# The following setting is a placeholder:
# To integrate screening against lists of previously compromised passwords,
# additional tooling/integration is required outside of pam_pwquality.
# For example, an external script or service might set:
#   reject_compromised_password = 1
#
# Note:
# Password hints are not provided and should not be used, as they may inadvertently disclose useful
# information to an attacker.
#
# In addition, it is recommended that password-based authentication
# be supplemented with multi-factor authentication and risk-based techniques.
