# Note:
# - Although this configuration encourages longer (up to 64-character) passphrases,
#   it does not impose an upper limit. Users should be allowed to choose secure, memorable passphrases.
#
# - Screening against lists of previously compromised passwords should be integrated
#   with external tooling or services, as this check is beyond the built-in functionality.
#
# - Password hints are deliberately not supported here to avoid giving attackers any clues.
#
# - Password-based authentication should be augmented with multi-factor and risk-based
#   authentication mechanisms through other system components.
