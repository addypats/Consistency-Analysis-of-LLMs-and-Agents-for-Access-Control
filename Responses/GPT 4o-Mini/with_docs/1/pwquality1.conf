# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This configuration file has been crafted in accordance with NIST SP 800-63B recommendations.
# It encourages long passphrases (up to 64 characters) over complex, composition‐focused passwords,
# while also screening against obvious weaknesses and common or compromised passwords.
#
# Password length: Although a minimum of 8 characters is required by some systems, this policy
# mandates a minimum length of 15 characters to promote passphrases.
minlen = 15
#
# Complexity requirements are intentionally not enforced here since mandating special characters
# can lead to predictable substitutions. By setting all credit values to 0, we avoid enforcing
# composition rules and instead encourage longer, more memorable passwords.
dcredit = 0
ucredit = 0
lcredit = 0
ocredit = 0
#
# Enable dictionary checking to help catch obvious weaknesses. By comparing new passwords against
# a dictionary (which includes common words such as "password"), this setting helps mitigate the use
# of easily guessable and compromised passwords.
dictcheck = 1
dictpath = /usr/share/dict/words
#
# Note:
# - Screening against lists of previously compromised passwords should be performed by integrating
#   additional tools or services into the overall authentication framework.
# - Password hints must not be used since they can disclose sensitive clues to attackers.
# - Multi-factor authentication and risk-based authentication should be implemented to enhance
#   password-based authentication.
