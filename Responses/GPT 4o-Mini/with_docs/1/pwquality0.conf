# NOTE:
# • Although passwords must be at least eight characters by older standards, NIST now recommends 
#   long passphrases (at least 15 characters, up to 64 characters) for improved security.
#
# • New passwords should be monitored for sequential number strings and common dictionary words.
#
# • It is recommended to screen new passwords against lists of previously breached passwords 
#   using an external service.
#
# • Password hints must not be used as they may provide attackers with clues.
#
# • In addition to the password quality requirements above, organizations should enhance password‐
#   based authentication with multi-factor and risk-based techniques.
