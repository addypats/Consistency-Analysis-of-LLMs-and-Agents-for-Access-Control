# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This configuration is designed to help satisfy modern password policy guidelines
# as described in NIST SP 800-63B. It encourages long, memorable passphrases over
# complex, composition-driven passwords.
#
# Passwords must be a minimum of 15 characters in length (NIST recommends at least 15).
minlen = 15
#
# While not all implementations support a maximum length setting, allowing very long
# passwords (up to 64 characters) lets users choose passphrases for better security.
maxlen = 64
#
# Enable dictionary checking to help prevent the use of obvious, common words
# (for example, "password") and predictable sequences.
dictcheck = 1
#
# NOTE:
# The pwquality facility does not itself scan passwords against lists of previously
# compromised passwords. It is recommended that integration with a breached-passwords
# service (such as those using pwned-passwords technology) be implemented separately.
#
# Composition rules that force users to include a certain number of special characters,
# digits, or uppercase letters are intentionally not enforced here, since such rules
# often lead to predictable substitutions. Long, memorable passwords are encouraged.
#
# Organizations are strongly advised not to use password hints, as these can inadvertently
# reveal clues to potential attackers. (This policy must be enforced by other system measures.)
#
# Finally, while this file addresses password quality, password-based authentication
# should be supplemented with multi-factor and risk-based authentication approaches.
#
# End of configuration.
