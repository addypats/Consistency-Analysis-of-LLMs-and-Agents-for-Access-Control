# Note: The pwquality module does not natively enforce detection of sequential number strings.
# It is recommended that your authentication system employ additional monitoring
# (via supplementary PAM modules or external tools) to detect such patterns.

# Note: Organizational policy prohibits the use of password hints,
# as these can divulge critical clues to potential attackers.

# Note: Screening new passwords against lists of previously compromised passwords
# should be implemented with external tools or by configuring your PAM stack appropriately.
# This file does not directly support such a check.

# Note: For enhanced security, password-based authentication should be augmented
# with multi-factor authentication and risk-based authentication techniques where possible.
