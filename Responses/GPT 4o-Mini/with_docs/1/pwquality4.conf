# While there is no directive to enforce a maximum passphrase length in this file,

# by NIST (see https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html).

# Note: Screening against lists of previously compromised passwords, enforcing multi‐factor 
# authentication, and disallowing password hints should be provided by additional security 
# modules and system policies outside of this file.
