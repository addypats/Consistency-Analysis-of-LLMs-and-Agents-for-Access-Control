# NOTE:
#
# - Although a minimum of eight characters is permitted, users are strongly encouraged
#   to choose passwords of at least 15 characters.
#
# - Screening passwords against databases of compromised passwords is beyond the scope
#   of this file. Ensure that additional tools or modules are in place to reject breached passwords.
#
# - This configuration does not support password hints. Ensure that system policies disable
#   any password hint functionality.
#
# - Enhancements such as multi-factor authentication and risk-based authentication should be
#   implemented within your overall authentication framework and are not handled here.
