# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file sets password complexity requirements.
# Note: Several of the security policies (e.g. account lockout, inactivity timeout,
# password expiration, password history, enforced MFA, etc.) must be configured
# via PAM modules and other system management tools. Only password quality
# criteria are set here.
#
# Enforce a minimum password length of 12 characters.
minlen = 12
#
# Require at least one digit.
dcredit = -1
#
# Require at least one lowercase letter.
lcredit = -1
#
# Require at least one uppercase letter.
ucredit = -1
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Additional security policy rules (to be enforced elsewhere):
#
# • Change vendor-supplied defaults and disable unnecessary default accounts.
#
# • Remove or disable inactive accounts within 90 days.
#
# • Lock out a user ID after no more than six failed authentication attempts.
#
# • Set the lockout duration to a minimum of 30 minutes or until an administrator re-enables the account.
#
# • Require re-authentication if a session has been idle for more than 15 minutes.
#
# • Enforce password change at least once every 90 days.
#
# • Prevent reuse of the last four passwords/passphrases.
#
# • Set first-time and reset passwords to unique values that must be changed immediately on first use.
#
# • Require that authentication (password, biometric, smart card, token, etc.) is encrypted during transmission and storage.
#
# • Limit invalid authentication attempts (e.g. lock out after 10 attempts with a 30-minute duration or pending identity confirmation).
#
# • Change passwords if there is any suspicion of compromise.
#
# • Enforce and document multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all system and remote access.
#
# • Ensure passwords are not hardcoded in scripts and are periodically changed.
#
# These policies must be implemented using appropriate system configuration and
# PAM settings outside of pwquality.conf.
