# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file sets password quality requirements. Other account security measures
# (vendor defaults removal, inactive account cleanup, repeated access lockouts,
# idle session reauthentication, password history enforcement, MFA, etc.) must be
# implemented via appropriate PAM modules, system account management tools, or
# other configuration files.
#
# Enforce strong passwords:
# - Minimum password length of 12 characters.
# - Require at least one digit and at least one alphabetic character.
#
minlen = 12
minclass = 2
dcredit = -1
lcredit = -1

# Note:
# • Inactive user accounts must be removed/disabled after 90 days via system account management.
# • Repeated access attempts, with lockout after 6 or 10 failed attempts and a lockout duration
#   of at least 30 minutes (or until administrative intervention), should be configured via PAM.
# • Sessions idle for more than 15 minutes must trigger re-authentication; set this via the session settings.
# • Password history (disallowing reuse of the last four passwords) is enforced using pam_pwhistory.
# • Forced password changes every 90 days and ensuring unique, first-time use passwords need additional tools.
# • Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all access is to be configured separately.
# • Hardcoded passwords and infrequent changes violate policy and must be avoided.
#
# For further guidance, please refer to NIST SP 800-63B and internal security policies.
