# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This configuration specifies requirements for password composition.
# Note: Many of the broader account and authentication policies (e.g.,
# account lockout, password aging, password history, MFA, inactive account
# removal, etc.) must be implemented via other PAM modules or system settings.
#
# The following settings enforce the password’s minimum length and basic
# composition requirements. In this implementation we choose a minimum length
# of 12 characters (the stricter requirement) and require at least one digit.
#
# Passwords must contain both numeric and alphabetic characters.
#
# Parameter explanations:
#
#   minlen
#       Minimum acceptable length for the new password.
#
#   dcredit
#       Specifies the maximum credit for digits. A negative value forces
#       the new password to contain at least the absolute value of digits.
#
#   minclass
#       Minimum number of required character classes (uppercase, lowercase,
#       digits, others). While not a perfect substitute for a “letter” check,
#       increasing this value can help enforce a variety of character types.
#
minlen = 12
dcredit = -1
minclass = 2

# Non–pwquality.conf requirements (to be implemented elsewhere):
#
#  * Change vendor-supplied defaults and remove or disable unnecessary default accounts.
#  * Remove/disable inactive user accounts within 90 days.
#  * Lock out a user after not more than six repeated access attempts;
#    alternatively, some policies require locking after 10 attempts.
#  * Set the account lockout duration to at least 30 minutes or until an administrator
#    re-enables the user.
#  * Require re-authentication if a session is idle for more than 15 minutes.
#  * Enforce password change at least once every 90 days.
#  * Prevent reuse of the last four passwords (password history).
#  * Provide unique, temporary passwords for first-time use and resets,
#    forcing immediate change on first login.
#  * Ensure that all authentication (passwords, biometrics, smart cards, tokens)
#    is encrypted in transit and storage.
#  * Implement and document multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all access.
#  * Prohibit hardcoded passwords in scripts and require periodic password changes.
#
# For complete compliance, configure the appropriate PAM modules (e.g., pam_faillock,
# pam_pwhistory, pam_time, etc.) and system settings as referenced by security guidelines.
