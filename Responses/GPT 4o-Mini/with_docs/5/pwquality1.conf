# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file configures the password quality requirements enforced by pam_pwquality.
#
# The following settings help meet the security policy for passwords:
#
# • Enforce a minimum password/passphrase length of 12 characters.
# • Require that passwords include at least one numeric digit and one alphabetical character.
#
minlen = 12
dcredit = -1
lcredit = -1
#
# NOTE:
# Many of the remaining security requirements (such as vendor-default changes, account lockout
# after repeated failed attempts, inactive account removal, mandatory password changes every 90 days,
# password history (remembering the last 4 passwords), MFA enforcement, idle session re-authentication,
# and ensuring unique initial/reset passwords) are beyond the scope of pam_pwquality.
#
# It is recommended that these policies be implemented using additional security mechanisms
# (for example, PAM modules like pam_faillock, pam_unix with the 'remember' option, session timeout scripts,
# and dedicated account management tools) as part of the overall system security configuration.
#
# For contexts where a minimum length of 7 characters (with numeric and alphabetic characters)
# is required (see policy reference 8.2.3), ensure that the appropriate modules and configurations are applied.
