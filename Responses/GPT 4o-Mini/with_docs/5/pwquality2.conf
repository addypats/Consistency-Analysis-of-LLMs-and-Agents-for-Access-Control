# Note: Many of the overall password and account management rules outlined in our policy
# (e.g. changing vendor-supplied defaults; disabling inactive or unnecessary accounts;
# locking accounts after repeated failed attempts; idle session re‐authentication;
# password expiration; password history; first‐time and reset password handling;
# multifactor authentication; and prohibition of hardcoded passwords in scripts)
# must be implemented through other mechanisms (such as PAM modules, account management
# tools, and network access controls). This file only governs password quality via pam_pwquality.
#
# Password quality requirements as specified:
#
# - Passwords/passphrases must have a minimum length of 12 characters and contain both
#   numeric and alphabetic characters. (See 8.3.6)
#
# - (Less restrictive rules—minimum 7 characters with numeric and alphabetic content—are
#   superseded by the above for high-assurance accounts.) (See 8.2.3)
#
# The following settings enforce the above password quality requirements.
#
minlen = 12
dcredit = -1
minclass = 2
