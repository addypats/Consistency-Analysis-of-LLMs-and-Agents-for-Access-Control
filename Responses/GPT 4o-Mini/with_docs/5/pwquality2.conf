# This file configures parameters for the PAM pwquality module.
# It is intended to enforce password‐quality requirements per
# NIST SP 800-63B and other best practices.
#
# NOTE: Many of the additional rules (e.g. vendor‐default changes,
# disabling inactive accounts, account lockout, idle session re-authentication,
# password expiration, password history, MFA, etc.) must be configured
# using other mechanisms (e.g. PAM modules, account management tools, or other
# system policies). This file only controls password complexity and quality.
#
# Password must be a minimum of 12 characters in length.
minlen = 12
#
# Ensure that at least one numeric digit is included.
# A negative value for dcredit forces the inclusion of at least one digit.
dcredit = -1
#
# Ensure that the password contains alphabetic characters.
# Using minclass = 2 requires that the password includes characters
# from at least two of the character classes (e.g. digits and letters).
minclass = 2
#
# The following rules are addressed elsewhere in system configuration:
#
# • Change vendor-supplied defaults and disable unnecessary default accounts.
# • Remove or disable inactive user accounts within 90 days.
# • Limit repeated access attempts by locking out the user ID after no more than six attempts.
# • Set the lockout duration to a minimum of 30 minutes or until an administrator unlocks the account.
# • Require re-authentication after 15 minutes of inactivity.
# • Enforce password changes at least every 90 days.
# • Prevent reuse of any of the last four passwords.
# • Set initial or reset passwords to a unique value per user and require change on first use.
# • Enforce the use of MFA for all access into sensitive environments.
# • Ensure passwords are not hardcoded in scripts and are periodically changed.
#
# For full compliance, supplement this configuration with appropriate settings
# in PAM, account policies, and additional security modules.
