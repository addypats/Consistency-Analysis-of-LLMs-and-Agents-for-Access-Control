# The settings below enforce the password quality requirements where applicable.
# Note: Many of the overall system, account, and session controls (e.g. vendor‐supplied defaults,
# disabling inactive accounts, account lockout, session re-authentication, password history, MFA,
# and password reset policies) must be implemented via other mechanisms (e.g. PAM configuration,
# account management scripts, centralized authentication, etc.) and are not configurable here.
#
# Password complexity enforced via pwquality:
#
# • Enforce a minimum password length of 12 characters.
# • Require at least one digit.
# • Require at least one uppercase letter.
# • Require at least one lowercase letter.
