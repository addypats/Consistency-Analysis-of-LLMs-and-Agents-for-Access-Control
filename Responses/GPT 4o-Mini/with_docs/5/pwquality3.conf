# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file provides settings for enforcing password quality. Note that many
# of the comprehensive security requirements (e.g. vendor default changes,
# account inactivity, lockout policies, session re‐authentication, password
# history, MFA, etc.) must be implemented via additional PAM and system
# configuration files. Only those aspects that directly affect the composition
# of users’ passwords are configurable here.
#
# POLICY REQUIREMENTS IMPLEMENTED IN THIS FILE:
#
# • Passwords must be “strong.” In our policy the minimum length is set to 12
#   characters (even though some guidance states a minimum of 7, we follow the
#   stricter requirement) and they must include both numeric and alphabetic
#   characters.
#
# The following settings enforce this:
#
# minlen
#   Specifies the minimum acceptable size for the new password. Here, we set
#   it to the stricter value of 12 characters.
#
# dcredit
#   A negative value forces at least that many digits to appear in the password.
#   Setting dcredit = -1 requires at least one numeric digit.
#
# minclass
#   Specifies the minimum number of required different character classes. By
#   setting this to 2, we require that the password include characters from at
#   least two classes (ensuring both alphabetic and numeric characters appear).
#
minlen = 12
dcredit = -1
minclass = 2

#
# REMINDER:
#
# The following policy rules are NOT configured here and must be implemented
# using other mechanisms (e.g. PAM modules, system settings, administrative
# procedures):
#
# • Always change vendor-supplied defaults and remove/disable unnecessary accounts.
# • Remove/disable inactive user accounts within 90 days.
# • Limit repeated access attempts by locking out the user after no more than six
#   attempts, and set the lockout duration to at least 30 minutes (or until unlocked
#   by an administrator).
# • If a session is idle for more than 15 minutes, require re-authentication.
# • Change user passwords at least once every 90 days.
# • Prevent reuse of any of the last four passwords.
# • Set initial/reset passwords to unique values and require immediate change on first use.
# • Enforce that user access authentication (password, biometrics, smart card, token)
#   is encrypted in transmission and storage.
# • Limit invalid authentication attempts as specified and confirm the user’s
#   identity before lifting lockout.
# • Require immediate password changes if compromise is suspected.
# • Implement and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all access.
# • Ensure that passwords are not hardcoded in scripts and are periodically updated.
#
# Make sure the other components of your security architecture address these points.
