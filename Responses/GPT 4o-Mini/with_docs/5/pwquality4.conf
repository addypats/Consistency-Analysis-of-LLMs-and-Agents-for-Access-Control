# Note: Several of the desired policies (such as disabling vendor defaults,
# removing inactive accounts, locking out after repeated invalid attempts,
# idle session re-authentication, password aging, password history, first‚Äêuse
# password changes, enforced MFA, and avoiding hardcoded passwords) are not
# handled via pwquality(5). They must be implemented by additional mechanisms
# (such as PAM modules, account management systems, and network or system policies).
