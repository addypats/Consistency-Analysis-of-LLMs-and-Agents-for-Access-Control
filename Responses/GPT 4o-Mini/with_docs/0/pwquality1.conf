# Note:
# - The requirement that passwords be changed every 90 days should be configured
#   via password aging settings (e.g., in /etc/login.defs or using chage).
#
# - Preventing reuse of passwords for 1 year is typically managed by the password
#   history module (e.g., pam_pwhistory), not via pwquality.conf.
#
# - Avoiding personal information (such as social security numbers, nicknames,
#   relatives’ names, birth dates, etc.) is beyond the capabilities of pwquality.conf.
