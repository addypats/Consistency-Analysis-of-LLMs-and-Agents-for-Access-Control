# Password quality settings are checked by pam_pwquality.

# Note: Some of the following policies (such as mandatory change every 90 days
# and preventing password reuse for 1 year) are typically enforced via
# account aging (e.g. with chage or /etc/login.defs) and the PAM history module
# (e.g. pam_pwhistory). The “remember” option here is provided as an example
# to recall the previous 4 passwords (90 days × 4 ≈ 1 year), but ensure your PAM
# configuration also enforces these policies.

# Enforce at least one lowercase letter.

# Check for dictionary words.

# Prevent reuse of recent passwords (approx. last 1 year if passwords are changed every 90 days).
