#
# NOTE: Some of the following policies (e.g. maximum password age and
# prevention of password reuse) must be set using other security
# and PAM modules (for example, in /etc/login.defs and via pam_pwhistory).
#
# Policy requirements:
# • Passwords must be changed every 90 days.
# • Passwords cannot be reused for 1 year.
# • Passwords must have a minimum length of 10 characters.
# • Passwords must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter,
#   one digit, and one special character (from the set:
#   !@#$%^&*_+=?/~’;’,<>|\).
# • Passwords must not be derivable from easily associated personal information
#   (such as usernames, social security numbers, nicknames, relatives’ names, birth dates, etc).
# • Passwords must not be common dictionary words or simple acronyms.
