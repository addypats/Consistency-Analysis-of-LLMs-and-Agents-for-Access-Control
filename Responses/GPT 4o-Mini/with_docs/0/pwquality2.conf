# Note:
# • Password expiration (every 90 days) and preventing password reuse for 1 year are not
#   controlled via pwquality.conf. These policies should be enforced by PAM modules
#   (e.g., pam_unix and pam_pwhistory) or in system account settings (such as in /etc/login.defs
#   or /etc/shadow).
# • Ensure that the appropriate configuration is also applied in those areas to fully enforce
#   the desired password expiration and history rules.
