# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file configures password quality requirements via pam_pwquality.
# Note: Some policies – such as forcing a change every 90 days and
# disallowing password reuse for 1 year – are not enforced here.
# They must be set in the appropriate PAM/account management configuration
# (for example, via “chage” and the “remember” option in pam_unix).
#
# Require passwords to be at least 10 characters long.
minlen = 10
#
# Require that at least three of the following character classes are used:
# uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and others.
minclass = 3
#
# Enforce at least one digit.
dcredit = -1
#
# Enforce at least one non-alphanumeric (special) character.
ocredit = -1
#
# Reject passwords that contain the username.
reject_username = 1
#
# Check against a dictionary to help avoid common words/acronyms.
dictcheck = 1

# The computing system permits the following special characters:
# !@#$%^&*_+=?/~’;’,<>|\
# (Actual permitted characters may be further enforced by the login service.)
#
# Additional policies – such as ensuring passwords are not tied to the account owner's
# personal information (e.g. social security number, relatives’ names, birth dates) –
# should be implemented via separate checks outside of this file.
