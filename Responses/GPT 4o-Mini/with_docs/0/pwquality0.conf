# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# Password Policy Settings
#
# 1. Minimum password length is set to 10 characters.
# 2. Passwords must include at least one numeric character.
# 3. Passwords must include at least one uppercase letter.
# 4. Passwords must include at least one lowercase letter.
# 5. Passwords must include at least one special (non-alphanumeric) character.
#
# Note:
# - The rule “Passwords must be changed every 90 days” is typically enforced
#   by password aging settings in /etc/shadow (or via PAM modules such as pam_unix)
#   and is not handled by pwquality.
#
# - Preventing use of dictionary words, acronyms, and any personal information
#   (like username, SSN, nickname, relatives’ names, birth date, etc.) is partly
#   enforced by enabling user-specific checks below. However, further configuration
#   (for example, in pam_pwhistory or additional modules) may be required to fully
#   prevent such choices.
#
# - The “Passwords cannot be reused for 1 year” rule should be implemented with
#   a password history module (e.g., pam_pwhistory) rather than with pwquality.
#
# The following are the pwquality settings:
minlen = 10
dcredit = -1       # Require at least one digit (negative value means “need 1 or more”)
ucredit = -1       # Require at least one uppercase letter
lcredit = -1       # Require at least one lowercase letter
ocredit = -1       # Require at least one special character

usercheck = 1      # Disallow passwords that contain the username
dictcheck = 1      # Reject passwords containing dictionary words
