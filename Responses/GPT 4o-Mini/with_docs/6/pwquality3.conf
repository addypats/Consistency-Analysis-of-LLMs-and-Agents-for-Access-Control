# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file is intended to enforce password quality requirements.
# Note: Not all of the requested policies can be enforced via pwquality;
# additional PAM, account, and session configuration is required for policies
# related to MFA, password expiration, lockouts, inactivity session locks, and
# login attempt monitoring. Refer to the relevant PAM modules and system settings
# for those rules.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 1. MFA Considerations:
#
#    Use MFA wherever possible. While pwquality cannot enforce MFA, ensure that
#    PAM and related authentication modules are configured appropriately (see 2.1).
#
# 2. Minimum Password Length:
#
#    For password‐only accounts a minimum length of 14 characters is required.
#    For MFA-enabled accounts the minimum length may be 8 characters.
#    Since pwquality.conf supports a single “minlen” value, we set the default to 14.
#    (For MFA-enabled accounts, use PAM conditionals or additional modules to allow a lower limit.)
minlen = 14
#
# 3. Maximum Password Length:
#
#    Do not limit the maximum password length. (pwquality imposes no maximum by default.)
#    Therefore, we leave any maximum-length limitation unset.
#
# 4. Character Requirements:
#
#    Allow all character types but require at least one non‐alphabetic character
#    for password‐only accounts. To require at least one digit or symbol, we
#    require one “other” (non-alphabetic) character.
ocredit = -1
#
# 5. Password Expiration:
#
#    In the event of a breach, require an immediate password change, with an annual
#    expiration as a backstop. Note: pwquality does not manage password aging.
#    Configure expiration via your system’s account management (e.g. /etc/login.defs,
#    chage, or similar tools).
#
# 6. Bad Passwords and History:
#
#    Check new passwords against a deny list of known weak or common passwords as well
#    as the previous 5 passwords. The “dictpath” option points to an internal deny list.
#    The “remember” option ensures the last 5 passwords cannot be reused.
dictpath = /etc/security/pwquality/common_passwords.txt
remember = 5
#
# 7. Password Change Delay:
#
#    Enforce a minimum interval of 1 day between password changes. (This requirement
#    is usually enforced in the PAM configuration rather than in pwquality.)
#    For clarity, document the desired delay here:
# minage = 1
#
# 8. Session Locking:
#
#    Lock the current session after 15 minutes or less of inactivity.
#    This configuration is not managed by pwquality; use your display manager or
#    screen locking tool to implement this behavior.
#
# 9. Account Lockout and Retry Throttling:
#
#    After five consecutive failed login attempts, temporarily lock the account for
#    at least 15 minutes, with time-doubling delays between each retry (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, …)
#    and a permanent lockout after 12 retries (requiring an IT reset).
#    Again, this behavior must be configured using PAM’s faillock or equivalent modules.
#
# 10. Alerting and Account Suspension:
#
#     Monitor and alert key personnel when bad login attempts reach the login limit,
#     and automatically suspend accounts after 45 days without a valid login.
#     These are administrative policies implemented outside of pwquality.
#
# 11. Password Hints:
#
#     Do not allow user-defined password hints at login. This policy must be enforced
#     via your PAM configuration.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Additional Options (defaults are acceptable unless otherwise required):
#
# Reject passwords that contain the username.
reject_username = 1
#
# Other options can be added here if system-specific policy adjustments are needed.
#
# End of /etc/security/pwquality.conf
