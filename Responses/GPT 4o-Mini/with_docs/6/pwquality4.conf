# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file is used by the libpwquality module to enforce password quality.
#
# POLICY OVERVIEW:
#
# • Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible. (See 2.1)
#
# • For password‐only accounts, require a minimum password length of 14 characters.
#   For MFA-enabled accounts, require a minimum of 8 characters.
#   (Note: Since pwquality.conf cannot differentiate account types, we set the strict policy here
#   for password-only accounts. Adjust the PAM configuration for MFA-enabled accounts accordingly.)
minlen = 14
#
# • Do not impose an artificial maximum password length.
#   (The system will accept passwords as long as system constraints allow.)
#
# • Allow all character types but require at least one non‐alphabetic character for password‐only accounts.
#   Since pwquality does not allow an “either/or” requirement for digits or punctuation,
#   we enforce at least one digit by requiring one non‐alphabetic character.
dcredit = -1
#
# • In the event of a breach, force an immediate password change with an annual expiration as a backstop.
#   (Password expiration and immediate change are configured via PAM modules or system account settings,
#   not in pwquality.conf.)
#
# • On new password creation, check against an internal deny list of known bad or weak passwords
#   (including at least 20 common passwords) and prevent reuse of the previous 5 passwords.
#   (This is typically enforced via pam_pwhistory or a custom script rather than here.)
#
# • Enforce a minimum delay of one day between password changes.
#   (This setting must be applied in the PAM or account management configuration.)
#
# • Lock the current session after 15 minutes (or less) of inactivity.
#   (Session locking is managed by desktop or system session policies, not by pwquality.)
#
# • Apply a temporary account lockout (15 minutes or more) after five consecutive failed login attempts,
#   with time-doubling throttling (0, 1, 2, 4, 8 … minutes) between retries, and a permanent lockout
#   (requiring an IT reset) after 12 retries.
#   (Account lockout and throttling are configured via PAM modules such as pam_faillock or pam_tally2.)
#
# • Monitor and alert key personnel when the number of failed login attempts reaches the limit.
#   (This alerting must be set up in the organization’s monitoring systems, not in this file.)
#
# • Automatically suspend the account after 45 days without a valid login.
#   (Account inactivity suspension is managed via system or directory policies.)
#
# • Do not allow user-defined password "hints" at login.
#   (This is a configuration setting in the login manager, not in pwquality.conf.)
