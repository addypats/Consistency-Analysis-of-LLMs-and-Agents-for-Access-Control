# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file establishes core password‐quality settings.
# Note: Several of the rules described in our comprehensive password policy
# (including MFA requirements, password aging, history, lockout, inactivity,
# and login hint prevention) must be enforced via corresponding PAM modules
# or additional system configuration. This file only governs checks performed
# by the pwquality library.
#
# MFA Policy:
#   - Use MFA wherever possible. For MFA‐enabled accounts, use a minimum length
#     of 8 characters (configured via PAM if needed). For password‐only accounts,
#     the minimum password length is set below.
#
# Password Length:
#   - For accounts without MFA, require a minimum of 14 characters.
#   - Maximum length: do not impose any artificial limit (system constraints only).
minlen = 14

# Character requirements:
#   - All character types are allowed.
#   - For password‐only accounts, require at least one non‐alphabetic character.
#     (Setting ocredit to -1 forces the inclusion of at least one digit or symbol.)
ocredit = -1

# Dictionary and history checks:
#   - Enable a dictionary check that can be configured to reference an internal deny list
#     of at least 20 common weak passwords.
#   - Note: Checking against the previous 5 passwords should be handled by pam_pwhistory.
dictcheck = 1
# dictpath = /etc/security/weak_passwords
# (Uncomment and set dictpath to the file holding known weak passwords if available.)

# Password expiration:
#   - In the event of a breach the policy is to require an immediate change,
#     with an annual expiration serving as a backstop.
#   - PASSWORD AGING is managed outside this file (typically via PAM and shadow settings).

# Password change delay:
#   - Enforce at least a one-day delay between password changes.
#   - (This is implemented through PAM configuration, e.g., pam_unix's "min_days" setting.)

# Account lockout and throttling:
#   - Temporary lockout of 15 minutes (or longer) after five consecutive failed attempts;
#   - Exponential (time-doubling) throttling between retries (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, etc. minutes);
#   - Permanent lockout (requiring IT reset) after 12 failed retries.
#   - (These rules must be implemented via appropriate PAM modules such as pam_faillock.)

# Session and account management:
#   - Automatically lock the current session after 15 minutes (or less) of inactivity.
#   - Automatically suspend the account after 45 days without a valid login.
#   - (These settings are not handled by pwquality and should be configured in session
#     management and account policy settings.)
#
# Login configuration:
#   - Do not allow user-defined password hints at login. This too must be managed
#     in the login configuration outside of this file.
