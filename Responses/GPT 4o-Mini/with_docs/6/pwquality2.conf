# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file enforces password quality policies. Note that many of the rules below
# (such as MFA configuration, session locking, account suspension, login throttling,
# password history, and expiration policies) must also be enforced via PAM modules,
# external account management tools, or system settings. This configuration covers only
# password quality‐related parameters.
#
# RULE 1 – MFA usage:
#   Use multifactor authentication wherever possible.
#   (MFA must be configured in your authentication system/PAM stack.)
#
# RULE 2 – Password length:
#   For password‐only accounts, a minimum length of 14 characters is required.
#   For MFA-enabled accounts, a minimum length of 8 characters is required.
#   Since this file applies systemwide, we set the default minimum to 14.
#   (Enforce the alternative minimum for MFA-enabled accounts via account-specific settings.)
minlen = 14
#
#   Maximum password length is intentionally not limited here.
#   (System constraints will apply, and no 'maxlen' value is set.)
#
# RULE 3 – Character requirements:
#   Allow all character types but require at least one non-alphabetic character for
#   password-only accounts. Here we require at least one digit (a non-alphabetic character)
#   by setting dcredit to -1. (If you wish to allow punctuation as the non-alphabetic requirement,
#   additional PAM rules may be needed.)
dcredit = -1
#
# RULE 4 – Password expiration:
#   In the event of a breach the password should be immediately changed,
#   with a maximum lifespan of 365 days as a backstop.
#   (Configure this via your system’s password aging settings such as /etc/login.defs or chage.)
#
# RULE 5 – Deny list and password history:
#   New passwords must be checked against an internal deny list of at least 20
#   common or weak passwords, and they must not repeat any of the previous 5 passwords.
#   The dictionary check is enabled here; however, the full implementation of a deny list
#   and password history is handled via PAM (e.g. pam_pwhistory).
dictcheck = 1
#
# RULE 6 – Delay between password changes:
#   A minimum delay of one day between password changes is required.
#   (This must be enforced in the PAM configuration with modules such as pam_pwhistory.)
#
# RULE 7 – Session lockout on inactivity:
#   User sessions should be locked after 15 minutes (or less) of inactivity.
#   (Configure this via your display or session manager or via PAM session modules.)
#
# RULE 8 – Account lockout on failed logins:
#   Temporary account lockout (for at least 15 minutes) should occur after 5 consecutive
#   failed attempts. Additionally, time-doubling throttling (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, … minutes)
#   should be enforced between retries, with a permanent lockout after 12 retries requiring IT reset.
#   (These rules are implemented using PAM modules such as pam_faillock.)
#
# RULE 9 – Alerting:
#   Monitor and alert key personnel when failed login attempts reach the lockout threshold.
#   (This requires integration with your system’s logging/alerting infrastructure.)
#
# RULE 10 – Account suspension:
#   Automatically suspend an account after 45 days without a valid login.
#   (This is normally enforced by system account management policies.)
#
# RULE 11 – Password hints:
#   Do not allow user-defined password hints at login.
#   (This must be disabled in the login configuration and is not provided by this file.)
#
# Additional pwquality parameters:
#   'retry' defines how many times a user can retry entering a new password in the event
#   that it fails the quality test.
retry = 3
