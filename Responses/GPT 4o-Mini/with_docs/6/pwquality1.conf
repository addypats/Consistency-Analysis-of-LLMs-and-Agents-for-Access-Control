# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This configuration file implements parts of our overall password and account security policy.
# Note that several rules (MFA, password history, expiration, session locking, account lockouts,
# throttling, login monitoring, account suspension, and disallowing password hints) are enforced
# by other PAM modules or system management tools. This file governs only password quality settings.
#
# 1. MFA is required wherever possible.
#    (Configure MFA via appropriate system/PAM modules outside this file.)
#
# 2. Password minimum lengths:
#    - MFA-enabled accounts require a minimum length of 8 characters.
#    - Password‐only accounts require a minimum length of 14 characters.
#    Since pwquality.conf is applied systemwide, set the minimum length to 8 for MFA-enabled accounts.
#    (Ensure that additional controls enforce a 14‐character minimum for password‐only accounts.)
minlen = 8
#
# 3. Maximum password length:
#    Do not limit the maximum length here; system constraints will apply.
#
# 4. Character requirements:
#    Allow all character types but require at least one non-alphabetic character.
#    Enforce at least one digit as a representative non-alphabetic character.
dcredit = -1
# (Other credits—notably ucredit, lcredit, and ocredit—are left unrestricted.)
#
# 5. Deny list for new passwords:
#    Check new password choices against an internal deny list of weak or common passwords.
#    The file specified by 'badwords' should contain at least 20 common passwords.
dictpath = /usr/share/cracklib/pw_dict
badwords = /etc/security/bad-passwords
#
# 6. Password expiration:
#    In the event of a breach, passwords should be changed immediately,
#    with an annual expiration as a backstop.
#    (This rule is implemented via system account management tools, not here.)
#
# 7. Password reuse and change delay:
#    Reject new passwords that match any of the previous 5 passwords and enforce a minimum
#    change delay of 1 day.
#    (This functionality is managed by the pam_pwhistory module.)
#
# 8. Session and account lockout policies:
#    - Lock the current session after 15 minutes (or less) of inactivity.
#    - After 5 consecutive failed login attempts, temporarily lock the account for 15 minutes or more.
#    - Use time-doubling throttling (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, … minutes) between retries, with a permanent
#      lockout (IT reset required) after 12 retries.
#    - Alert key personnel when failed login attempts reach the limit.
#    (These settings are enforced by appropriate PAM modules such as pam_faillock.)
#
# 9. Account suspension:
#    Automatically suspend the account after 45 days without a valid login.
#    (This is enforced by external account management policies.)
#
# 10. Password hints:
#     Do not allow user-defined password hints at login.
#     (This rule is implemented by the login system, not via pwquality.)
