# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file establishes password quality requirements.
# Note: Several policies (e.g., MFA, password history, expiration, session lock,
# account lockout, login throttling, inactivity suspension, and login hints)
# cannot be enforced by pwquality.conf alone. They must be implemented via
# additional PAM modules and system management tools. Comments below indicate
# the intended policy settings as guidance for overall system configuration.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Minimum Password Length
#
# By default, enforce a minimum length of 14 characters for password‐only accounts.
# For accounts with multi-factor authentication (MFA), a minimum length of 8 characters
# is recommended – configure this case via your PAM stack as needed.
minlen = 14
#
# Note: No maximum length is defined here so that passwords can be as long as system
# constraints permit.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2. Composition Requirements
#
# Allow all character types but require that a password include at least one non‐alphabetic
# character (i.e. at least two character classes overall). This may be met by including
# a digit or a punctuation/symbol along with letters.
minclass = 2
#
# If you wish to specifically force a non‐alphabetic character for password‐only accounts,
# consider additional PAM checks. For the pwquality library, the above “minclass” setting
# provides a baseline requirement.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 3. Deny List and Password Reuse
#
# Check new password choices against an internal deny list of known weak passwords.
# The file specified below should contain at least 20 common weak passwords (one per line).
dictpath = /etc/security/pwquality-denylist
#
# Note: Enforcement of checking against the previous 5 passwords is not handled here.
# Configure the appropriate PAM module (e.g. pam_pwhistory with "remember=5") to reject reuse.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 4. Password Change Frequency
#
# In the event of a compromise, require an immediate password change, with an annual
# expiration serving as a backstop. This expiration policy must be implemented using
# your account management and PAM password modules.
#
# Additionally, enforce a delay of at least one day between allowed password changes.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 5. Account and Session Locking
#
# The following policies are expected to be enforced via PAM and other system tools:
#
# - Lock the current session after 15 minutes (or less) of inactivity.
# - Temporarily lock an account for at least 15 minutes after five consecutive failed login attempts.
# - Apply time-doubling throttling between retries (e.g. delays of 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, … minutes)
#   and enforce a permanent lockout (requiring IT reset) after 12 retries.
# - Monitor and alert key personnel when the number of failed login attempts reaches the limit.
# - Automatically suspend an account after 45 days without a valid login.
# - Do not allow user-defined password hints during login.
#
# These settings should be implemented in the PAM configuration and any related security
# management systems.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 6. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
#
# Use MFA wherever possible. Although pwquality.conf does not control MFA settings,
# ensure that additional authentication factors are enabled for applicable accounts.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 7. Enforce for Root
#
# Optionally, enforce password quality for the root account.
enforce_for_root = 1
