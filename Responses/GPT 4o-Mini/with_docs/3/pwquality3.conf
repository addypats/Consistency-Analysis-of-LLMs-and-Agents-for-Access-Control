# - At least one character in the new password must be different from the old password.
# - The password must be at least 8 characters long.
# - The password is checked against a cracklib dictionary (words from the cracklib directory are not allowed).
# - The username (in any form) is not permitted to be part of the password.
# - The PAM module will enforce these rules and allow 3 retries before an error is returned.
