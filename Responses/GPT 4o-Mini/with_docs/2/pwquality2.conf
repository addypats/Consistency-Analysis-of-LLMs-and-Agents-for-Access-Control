# This file configures password quality settings via pam_pwquality.
# Note: Some of the policies below (password aging and handling)
# must be implemented via additional system configuration (e.g., chage, PAM limits)
#
# Password aging rules (enforce these via your account management tools):
#   • All passwords must be changed at least every 90 days.
#   • You are allowed to change your password only once every 2 days.
#
# Password handling rules (must be communicated/enforced by policy):
#   • Do not send passwords via email or other electronic communications.
#   • Do not share your password with anyone, including over the phone.
#   • Do not write down or store passwords electronically unless encrypted.
#
# Password quality requirements (enforced by pam_pwquality):
#   • Minimum password length of 8 characters
#   • At least 1 numeric character is required (dcredit = -1)
#   • At least 1 alphabetical character is required.
#     (Since pam_pwquality does not offer a direct “alpha” option,
#      we require one lowercase letter via lcredit = -1.
#      This enforces at least one alphabetic character; adjust as needed.)
#   • Passwords must not be based on a dictionary word (dictcheck enabled)
#   • Passwords must not contain or be part of the user name (usercheck enabled)
