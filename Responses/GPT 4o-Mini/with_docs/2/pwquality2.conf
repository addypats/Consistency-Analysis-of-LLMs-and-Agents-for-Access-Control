# /etc/security/pwquality.conf

# Enforce that new passwords meet the following quality requirements.
# Note: Some policies (such as forced rotations, communication restrictions,
# and change frequencies) must be implemented elsewhere (e.g., system policy, PAM, or user education).

# Minimum password length: at least 8 characters.
minlen = 8

# Require at least 1 digit.
dcredit = -1

# Require characters from at least 2 different character classes.
# This helps ensure that at least one alphabetic character is present
# (e.g., one numeric plus one letter will meet the requirement).
minclass = 2

# Check against a dictionary of common words to prevent use of simple passwords.
dictcheck = 1

# Prevent the password from containing the username.
reject_username = 1

# The following password policies must be enforced by other system mechanisms:
# - All passwords (e.g., email, web, computer, etc.) must be changed at least every 90 days.
# - Passwords must not be inserted into email messages or other forms of electronic communication
#   and should not be shared with anyone, including via email or phone conversations.
# - Passwords should not be written down or stored electronically without encryption.
# - You can only change your password once every two days.
