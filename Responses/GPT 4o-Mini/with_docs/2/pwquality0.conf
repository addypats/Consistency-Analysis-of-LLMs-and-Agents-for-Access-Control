# NOTE: The following file only enforces password “quality” rules.
# The password aging and handling policies below (e.g.,
# • Passwords must be changed at least every 90 days,
# • Passwords can only be changed once every 2 days,
# • Passwords must not be sent over email or other electronic channels,
# • Passwords should never be written down or stored unencrypted)
# must be implemented via your system’s account aging and security policies
# (for example, in /etc/login.defs, /etc/shadow, and IT policy documents).
#
# NIST Guidelines: https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html
#
# Password quality settings:
minlen=8
dcredit=-1            # Require at least 1 digit
lcredit=-1            # Require at least 1 lowercase letter (ensures at least one alpha)
reject_username=1     # Disallow using the username as part of the password
dictcheck=1           # Disallow passwords based on dictionary words
