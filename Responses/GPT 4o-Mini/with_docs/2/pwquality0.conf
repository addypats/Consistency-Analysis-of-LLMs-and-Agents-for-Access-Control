# Password Policy Guidelines:
# 1. All passwords (e.g., email, web, computer, etc.) must be changed at least every 90 days.
# 2. Passwords must not be inserted into email messages or other forms of electronic communication
#    and should not be shared with anyone, including via email or phone conversations.
# 3. Passwords should not be written down or stored electronically without encryption.
# 4. All passwords must be at least 8 characters long, contain at least 1 alphabetic and 1 numeric character,
#    should not be based on a dictionary word, and must not contain your name or user name.
# 5. You can only change your password once every two days.
#
# Note:
# Some of these guidelines (such as password expiration and minimum time between changes)
# are typically enforced via other system configuration tools (e.g., /etc/login.defs and chage)
# rather than via pwquality. The options below affect the composition of the password only.
