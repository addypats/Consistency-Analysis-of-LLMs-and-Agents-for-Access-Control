# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This configuration file helps enforce our password policies.
#
# NOTE:
# • Password aging (change every 90 days) and minimum interval between changes (password
#   may be changed only once every 2 days) must be set in the system’s password aging
#   configuration (e.g., in /etc/login.defs or per-user settings in /etc/shadow).
#
# • Do not include passwords in email messages or other forms of electronic communication,
#   and do not store them in plain text.
#
# • Passwords should not be written down or stored electronically without encryption.
#
# Policy enforcement below:
minlen = 8            # Minimum length of passwords
dcredit = -1          # At least 1 numeric digit is required
minclass = 2          # Require at least two character classes (ensures at least one alphabetic + one numeric)
dictcheck = 1         # Check against dictionary words (if a suitable dictionary is available)
reject_username = 1   # Reject passwords that contain the username
