# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# NOTE: Some of the following organizational password policies (such as forcing
# a 90‐day maximum password age, disallowing password changes more often than
# every 2 days, and prohibiting sharing or unencrypted storage of passwords)
# are not enforced by libpwquality. Such policies should be implemented via
# other system configuration (e.g. /etc/login.defs, PAM modules, and user education).
#
# The settings below enforce that:
# • Passwords must be at least 8 characters long.
# • They must include at least 1 digit (dcredit = -1).
# • They must incorporate characters from at least 2 classes (minclass = 2),
#   ensuring that at least one alphabetic character is present.
# • Dictionary words are disallowed (dictcheck = 1).
# • The password cannot contain the user name (reject_username = 1).
