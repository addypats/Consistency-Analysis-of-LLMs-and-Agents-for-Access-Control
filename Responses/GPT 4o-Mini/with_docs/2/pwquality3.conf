# This file controls the password quality settings used by pam_pwquality.
# Note: Some of the policy rules (such as password expiration, 
# transmission restrictions, and change frequency limits) must be enforced
# through other system settings (e.g., /etc/login.defs, chage, etc.) or via
# organizational policy. Only the password composition requirements below
# are enforced by this configuration file.
#
# Requirements enforced below:
#
#  - Minimum password length of 8 characters.
#  - Must contain at least 1 numeric character.
#  - Must contain at least 1 alphabetical character.
#    (Since there is no single option to require “an alphabetic character” of any case,
#     we require at least one lowercase and one uppercase letter.)
#  - Passwords should not be based on a dictionary word or contain parts of the username.
#
# The following are our parameters:
minlen = 8
dcredit = -1        # At least one digit is required.
ucredit = -1        # At least one uppercase letter is required.
lcredit = -1        # At least one lowercase letter is required.
minclass = 3        # Require use of at least three character classes.
dictcheck = 1       # Enable dictionary check (passwords must not be common dictionary words).

# POLICY NOTES (for administrator reference – not enforced by pam_pwquality):
# - All passwords (e.g., email, web, computer, etc.) must be changed at least every 90 days.
# - Passwords must not be inserted into email messages or other forms of electronic communication and should not be shared.
# - Passwords should not be written down or stored electronically without encryption.
# - You can only change your password once every two days.
