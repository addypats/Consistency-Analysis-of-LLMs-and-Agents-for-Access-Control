# This file configures password quality settings. Note that rules regarding password aging 
# (e.g., must be changed at least every 90 days and only once every two days),
# and rules about not transmitting or storing passwords in plain text, must be enforced
# by other system settings (for example, in /etc/login.defs, /etc/shadow, or organizational policy).
#
# The following settings enforce complexity requirements:
minlen = 8                     # Minimum password length of 8 characters
dcredit = -1                   # Require at least 1 digit
lcredit = -1                   # Require at least 1 lowercase letter
ucredit = -1                   # Require at least 1 uppercase letter
minclass = 2                   # Require characters from at least 2 different classes
dictcheck = 1                  # Enable dictionary check to avoid dictionary words
reject_username = 1            # Reject passwords that contain the username

# Additional password policy rules (to be enforced elsewhere):
# - All passwords (e.g., email, web, computer, etc.) must be changed at least every 90 days.
# - Passwords must not be inserted into email messages or other forms of electronic communication
#   and should not be shared with anyone, including via email or phone conversations.
# - Passwords should not be written down or stored electronically without encryption.
# - Passwords must not be based on a dictionary word or be part of your personal name/user name.
# - Password changes are allowed only once every two days.
