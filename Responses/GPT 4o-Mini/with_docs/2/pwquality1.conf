# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# Password quality configuration.
#
# The following settings enforce that passwords:
# • are at least 8 characters long,
# • contain at least one digit,
# • contain at least one alphabetic character (a lowercase letter in this case),
# • are not based on a dictionary word,
# • do not include the user’s login name.
#
# Administrative policies (such as forcing password changes at least every 90 days,
# and restricting password changes to no more than once every 2 days) are not
# implemented here. They must be enforced via additional PAM modules, system
# configuration (e.g. /etc/login.defs), or external tools.
