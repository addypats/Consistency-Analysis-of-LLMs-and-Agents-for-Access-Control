# A check against a list of compromised, common, or context‐specific words (e.g., from breach corpuses,
# dictionaries, or user-specific data) is recommended. Enabling dictionary checking via the following
# parameters helps enforce that requirement.

# Note:
# • Normalization of Unicode characters (e.g. via NFKC or NFKD) should be applied by the verifier
#   before the secret is hashed.
# • No “hint” is stored and no specific personal questions are prompted.
# • Rate-limiting of authentication attempts should be implemented elsewhere.
# • No other complexity or composition rules are enforced.
