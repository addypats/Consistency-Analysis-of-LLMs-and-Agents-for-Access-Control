# Although the NIST guidelines permit subscriber-chosen secrets to be as long as 64 characters,
# libpwquality does not enforce a maximum length; systems should accept secrets up to 64 characters.
# (This file does not limit the length, so clients may choose secrets longer than the minimum.)

# If the chosen secret appears in the dictionary file specified below, it must be rejected.

# Notes:
# - Memorized secrets chosen randomly (such as PINs) may be fewer than 8 characters (as low as 6)
#   but this configuration is intended for subscriber-chosen secrets.
# - All printable ASCII and Unicode characters should be accepted.
# - Normalization of Unicode (e.g., NFKC or NFKD) prior to hashing should be performed by the verifier.
# - No truncation or additional complexity (e.g., requiring mixtures of character types) is enforced.
# - Rate limiting of failed authentication attempts must be implemented elsewhere.
# - Secret hints or prompts that use personal information are not allowed per the guidelines.
