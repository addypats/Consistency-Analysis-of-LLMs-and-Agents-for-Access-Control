# /etc/security/pwquality.conf

# Minimal length for passwords chosen by users is 8 characters.
minlen = 8

# Although memorized secrets chosen automatically by the system (e.g. randomly generated PINs)
# may be allowed to be shorter (at least 6 characters and possibly numeric), this configuration
# applies only to subscriber‐chosen passwords.

# The standard does not require enforcement of additional complexity rules (such as requiring a mix 
# of character classes). Therefore, no extra credit is subtracted for digits, uppercase, lowercase,
# or other characters.
dcredit = 0
ucredit = 0
lcredit = 0
ocredit = 0

# There is no imposed maximum length, but subscribers SHOULD be permitted secrets up to 64 characters.
# (Note: pwquality does not enforce an upper limit; applications should handle input accordingly.)

# Dictionary check: compare prospective passwords against a list of commonly-used, expected, or compromised values.
# When configured and provided with an appropriate dictionary (see dictpath), this helps prevent use of weak values.
dictcheck = 1
# dictpath can be set to a file containing compromised values (e.g., /etc/security/compromised-passwords)
# Uncomment and adjust the following line as needed:
# dictpath = /etc/security/compromised-passwords

# Note:
# - Verifiers are expected to handle normalization of Unicode (e.g., using NFKC/NFKD) prior to storing or comparing 
#   passwords. This configuration file does not perform normalization.
#
# - Verifiers SHOULD ensure that any stored hints are not accessible by unauthenticated claimants 
#   and do not prompt the user to choose secrets based on easily-guessable personal information.
#
# - Rate limiting for authentication attempts should be implemented separately.
#
# This configuration is intended to meet the NIST SP 800-63B guidelines for memorized secret strength and management.
