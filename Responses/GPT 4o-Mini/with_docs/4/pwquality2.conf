# Optionally, specify the path to a blacklist file containing compromised values.
# For example:
# dictpath = /etc/security/pwquality-blacklist.txt

# Note:
# - This configuration enforces a minimum of 8 characters for subscriber‚Äêchosen secrets.
# - No additional complexity (e.g., requiring digits, uppercase, etc.) is imposed.
# - All printing ASCII characters, including the space, and Unicode characters are accepted.
# - Normalization (e.g., NFKC/NFKD) should be applied by the verifier before hashing.
# - Truncation is not performed.
# - The policy relies on a blacklist check to reject compromised or trivial values.
