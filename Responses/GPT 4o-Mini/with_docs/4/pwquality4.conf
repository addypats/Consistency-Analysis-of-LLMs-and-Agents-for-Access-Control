# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This configuration implements password policy settings consistent with NIST SP 800-63B.
#
# Requirements:
# • Subscriber‑chosen memorized secrets MUST be at least 8 characters in length.
# • Secrets chosen by the CSP/verifier (e.g., randomly generated) use a different policy (minimum of 6 characters
#   and may be entirely numeric) which is not handled by this configuration file.
# • No additional composition rules (e.g., character-type mix or prohibiting sequential characters) are imposed.
# • Passwords appearing on a blacklist of commonly‐used, expected, or compromised values (e.g., breach corpuses,
#   dictionary words, or context-specific terms such as the service name or username) MUST be rejected.
#
# Note:
# • Passwords of up to at least 64 characters SHOULD be accepted.
# • The normalization of Unicode and consolidation of multiple consecutive spaces (to account for mistyping)
#   SHOULD be handled by the authentication backend.
# • Storing password “hints” or prompting for personal information (e.g., pet names) is disallowed elsewhere.
#

# Minimum length for subscriber‐chosen secrets: at least 8 characters.

# No additional composition requirements are imposed. Setting credit values to 0 disables
# additional checks for digits, uppercase, lowercase, or other characters.
dcredit = 0
ucredit = 0
lcredit = 0

# Ensure that passwords are checked against a dictionary (blacklist) of commonly-used or compromised values.

# Prevent the user’s username from being embedded in the password.
reject_username = 1

# (Optional) Number of allowed retries before failure. Adjust if necessary.
# retry = 3

# End of /etc/security/pwquality.conf configuration.
