#
# This configuration enforces the following requirements:
# • For subscriber‐chosen memorized secrets (passwords), a minimum length of 8 characters
# • No additional composition rules such as requiring mixtures of digits, uppercase,
#   lowercase, or special characters are imposed.
# • The verifier will check the chosen secret against a dictionary/blacklist of common
#   or compromised values and reject any listed value.
#
# Note: Other aspects (such as normalization of Unicode and rate limiting of attempts)
# are expected to be handled elsewhere in the authentication stack.
#

# Require subscriber-chosen passwords to be at least 8 characters long.
minlen = 8

# Do not require any additional character classes.

# Disable restrictions on repeating or sequential characters.
# (Setting these to 0 means that no additional check is performed against repeats or sequences.)

# Enable a dictionary (blacklist) check.
# A compromised or common password found in the dictionary should be rejected.
