# This file configures password quality requirements as described in NIST SP 800-63B.
#
# The policy requirements implemented here are:
# • Subscriber-chosen memorized secrets MUST be at least 8 characters.
# • No additional composition requirements (e.g., no mandatory mixtures of character types)
# • A blacklist check for compromised, commonly-used, or context-specific words is enabled.
#
# Note:
# • Memorized secrets chosen randomly (e.g., by a CSP) may be shorter (at least 6 characters)
#   and entirely numeric. This configuration is intended for subscriber-chosen secrets.
# • Unicode characters and full printing ASCII are allowed. Normalization (e.g., NFKC)
#   should be handled by the authentication layer prior to calling this module.
# • No truncation or forced complexity (beyond minimum length) is imposed.
#
# Minimum length for subscriber-chosen memorized secrets:
minlen = 8

# Do not require additional complexity; allow any characters.
# (A zero value for the credit options disables requirements for digits, uppercase,
# lowercase, or other characters beyond the minimum length.)
dcredit = 0    # Digit credit
ucredit = 0    # Uppercase credit
lcredit = 0    # Lowercase credit
ocredit = 0    # Other (special) character credit

# Enable dictionary (blacklist) check against a list of known compromised or common passwords.
dictcheck = 1

# Optionally specify a file containing words and patterns that are not allowed.
# Uncomment and set the path to a custom blacklist file if available:
# badwords_file = /etc/security/compromised-passwords.txt

# Note: Other policies such as rate-limiting of authentication attempts or
# preventing the use of password hints are to be enforced by additional mechanisms
# outside of this configuration file.
