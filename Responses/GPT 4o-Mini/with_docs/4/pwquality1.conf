# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This configuration enforces a memorized secret policy that:
# • Requires subscriber‐chosen secrets to be at least 8 characters long.
# • Does not impose additional composition rules (e.g. mixtures of digits,
#   upper‐case, lower‐case, or special characters).
# • Allows passwords (including all printing ASCII and Unicode characters)
#   of sufficient length (and permits at least 64 characters if chosen).
# • Checks candidate secrets against a blacklist of common, expected, or
#   compromised values.
# • Rejects passwords that include context‐specific words such as the username.
#
minlen = 8

# Do not enforce additional complexity; accept all character types.
# (Defaults for these parameters are overridden to avoid requiring digits,
# uppercase, lowercase, or special characters.)
dcredit = 0
ucredit = 0
lcredit = 0
ocredit = 0

# Enable dictionary/blacklist checking against compromised or common secrets.
dictcheck = 1

# Reject passwords that contain the username.
reject_username = 1

# Note:
# - Memorized secrets generated automatically by the CSP may be shorter (at
#   least 6 characters) and even numeric; this file governs subscriber‐chosen
#   secrets.
# - No transformations (such as collapsing consecutive spaces) or truncation is
#   performed. Verification counts each Unicode code point as a single character.
# - Unicode normalization (e.g. using NFKC or NFKD) should be applied by the
#   verifier prior to hashing.
# - Rate‐limiting of failed authentication attempts should be handled
#   separately.
