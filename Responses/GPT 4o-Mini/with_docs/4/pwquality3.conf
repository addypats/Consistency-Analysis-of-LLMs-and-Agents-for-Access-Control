# Password policy in accordance with NIST SP 800-63B guidance:
#
# - Subscriber‐chosen memorized secrets MUST be at least 8 characters in length.
# - No additional composition rules (e.g. forcing mixed character classes,
#   prohibiting consecutive or repeated characters) are imposed.
# - A dictionary (blacklist) check is enabled to help prevent selections
#   from lists of commonly-used or compromised passwords.
#
# Note: This file does not restrict the upper length (up to 64 characters)
# or mandate normalization of Unicode input. Such handling must be implemented
# by the application or authentication subsystem as needed.
