# Prevent password reuse; the following “remember” value is designed to block reuse over roughly 1 year,
# assuming passwords expire every 90 days.
remember = 4

# NOTE:
# - The requirement that passwords be changed every 90 days is typically enforced via password aging settings
#   (for example, in /etc/login.defs or via PAM modules such as pam_unix) rather than here.
#
# - The policy that passwords must not contain identifiable information (e.g. account owner’s name, birth date,
#   relatives' names, etc.) cannot be fully enforced by pwquality and must be addressed by additional system policies
#   or education.
#
# - Allowed special characters for this system include: !@#$%^&*_+=?/~’;’,<>|\
#   Since pwquality treats all non-alphanumeric characters as “special”, this configuration supports the policy.
