# NOTE:
# The following policies are not directly enforced by pwquality but must be set via other mechanisms:
#
# 1. Password Aging:
#    - Passwords MUST be changed every 90 days.
#      Configure this by setting the maximum password age (e.g., MAX_DAYS) in your system’s shadow file
#      or relevant account management tools (like /etc/login.defs).
#
# 2. Password Reuse:
#    - Passwords CANNOT be reused for 1 year.
#      Manage this by configuring the pam_pwhistory module (using the "remember" parameter) to remember
#      a sufficient number of previous passwords.
#
# 3. User-related data (username, social security number, nickname, relative’s names, birth date, etc.)
#    should not be allowed as part of the password.
#      This is typically enforced by the PAM modules or custom scripts. Make sure those mechanisms are in place.
