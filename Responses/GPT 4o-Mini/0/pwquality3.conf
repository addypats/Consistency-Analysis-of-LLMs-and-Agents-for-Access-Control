#
# Password Policy Settings
#
# 1. Passwords must be changed every 90 days.
#    (Note: This setting must be enforced via your PAM or account management configuration,
#           for example by setting appropriate parameters in /etc/login.defs or via pam_unix.)
#
# 2. Minimum password length: 10 characters.
#
# 3. Passwords must include a combination of alphabetic, numeric, and special characters.
#    - At least one digit is required.
#    - At least one special (non-alphanumeric) character is required.
#
# 4. Passwords must not be easily tied back to the account owner (e.g. username, social security number,
#    nickname, relativesâ€™ names, birth date, etc.). (Enforcement of this policy may require additional custom checks.)
#
# 5. Passwords must not be dictionary words or acronyms.
#
# 6. Password reuse is forbidden for 1 year.
#    (Note: This must be enforced via the pam_pwhistory module, e.g., by using the "remember" option in your PAM configuration.)
