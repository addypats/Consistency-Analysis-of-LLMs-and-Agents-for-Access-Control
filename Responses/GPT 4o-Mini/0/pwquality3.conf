# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file sets the quality requirements for new passwords.
#
# Note:
# • Some rules below (password aging and reuse policies) must be enforced via PAM
#   configuration (for example, in /etc/login.defs and the pam_unix module options)
#   and are not handled by pwquality.
# • The PAM settings should be adjusted to require password changes every 90 days
#   and prevent password reuse for 1 year.
#
# Require a minimum password length of 10 characters.
minlen = 10
#
# Require at least one digit, one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one special character.
# The negative values mean that at least one of each is required.
dcredit = -1
ucredit = -1
lcredit = -1
ocredit = -1
#
# Alternatively, ensuring the use of at least 4 character classes:
minclass = 4
#
# Enable dictionary check to help prevent the use of dictionary words or acronyms.
dictcheck = 1
#
# Prevent the password from containing the username (and by extension, personal information such as
# social security numbers, nicknames, relatives’ names, or birth dates should not be used).
reject_username = 1

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Reminder:
#
# To enforce that passwords are changed every 90 days and cannot be reused for one year,
# set the appropriate controls in your PAM configuration files (e.g., pam_unix.so’s "remember" option)
# and in /etc/login.defs (e.g., PASS_MAX_DAYS 90). These settings are not controlled by pwquality.
