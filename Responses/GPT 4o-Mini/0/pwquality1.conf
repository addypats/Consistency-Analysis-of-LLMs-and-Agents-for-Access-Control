# Password quality configuration file
#
# Note: Some of the following policies (password expiration and reuse)
# must be enforced via additional modules (e.g. pam_unix or pam_pwhistory)
# or system settings like /etc/login.defs.

# Require a minimum password length of 10 characters.
minlen = 10

# Ensure that at least 3 character classes are used (e.g. lowercase,
# uppercase, digits, and special characters). This helps enforce a mix of
# alphabetic, numeric, and special characters.
minclass = 3

# Require at least one digit.
dcredit = -1

# Require at least one special character.
ocredit = -1

# Prevent use of dictionary words and acronyms.
dictcheck = 1

# Disallow passwords that contain the username.
reject_username = 1

# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following policies are not directly handled by pwquality.conf:
#
# 1. Passwords must be changed every 90 days.
#    -> Enforce this policy via password aging settings (e.g., chage)
#       or via configuration in /etc/login.defs.
#
# 2. Passwords cannot be reused for 1 year.
#    -> Enforce this policy via pam_pwhistory (e.g., "remember" option)
#       in the PAM configuration (typically in /etc/pam.d/system-auth).
