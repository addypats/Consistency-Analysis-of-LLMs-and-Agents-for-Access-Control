#
# PASSWORD AGE POLICY:
# • Passwords must be changed every 90 days.
#   (This constraint is normally enforced via PAM/account settings such as in /etc/login.defs or with chage.)
#
# PASSWORD COMPLEXITY & LENGTH:
# • Minimum password length is set to 10 characters.
# • Passwords must include at least one digit, one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one special character.
#
minlen = 10
dcredit = -1
ucredit = -1
lcredit = -1
ocredit = -1
#
# DICTIONARY & PERSONAL INFO CHECKS:
# • Enforce a check against dictionary words (and acronyms) to discourage easily guessed passwords.
# • Prevent passwords that can be easily tied back to the user (such as username, social security number,
#   nickname, relative’s names, birth date, etc.). (Additional PAM configuration may be necessary to fully enforce
#   this requirement.)
#
dictcheck = 1
reject_username = 1
#
# PASSWORD HISTORY:
# • Disallow reuse of any of the previous 4 passwords (given a 90‐day change cycle, this prevents reuse
#   for approximately 1 year).
