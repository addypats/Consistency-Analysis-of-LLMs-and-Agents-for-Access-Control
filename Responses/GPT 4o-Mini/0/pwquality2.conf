# NOTE:
# The following password policies are not enforced via this file:
#
# 1. Password expiry: Users must change their passwords every 90 days.
#    This should be configured in /etc/login.defs using the PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter.
#
# 2. Password history/reuse: Passwords cannot be reused for 1 year.
#    To enforce this, configure the “remember” option in your PAM stack (e.g., in pam_unix.so)
#    so that at least the number of previous passwords covering a one‐year period is remembered.
#
# Additionally, avoid using personal data (e.g., social security number, nicknames,
# relative names, birth dates, etc.) when choosing passwords. This measure should be
# implemented via user education and, where possible, customized checks in your account
# management system.
