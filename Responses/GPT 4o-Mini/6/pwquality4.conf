# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file specifies password quality settings for password‐only accounts.
# Note: Some requirements (e.g. MFA, session locking, account lockouts, automatic
#       suspension, and notification on repeated failed attempts) must be handled
#       via additional PAM modules or external system configuration.
#
# [2.1] Use Multi-Factor Authentication wherever possible.
#
# [5.1.1] Minimum lengths:
#   - For password‐only accounts, enforce a minimum password length of 14 characters.
#   - For MFA-enabled accounts, a minimum of 8 characters is required.
#
# Since this file applies to password‐only accounts, we set the minimum length to 14.
minlen = 14
#
# Maximum password length:
#   - Do not impose an artificial maximum; system constraints will apply.
#
# [5.1.2] Allowed character types:
#   - All character types are allowed.
#   - For password‐only accounts, require at least one non‐alphabetic character.
#
# The following setting requires at least one non-alphabetic ("other") character.
ocredit = -1
#
# No additional credit requirements are imposed for digits, uppercase, or lowercase.
dcredit = 0
ucredit = 0
lcredit = 0
#
# [5.1.3] Password aging/breach response:
#   - Passwords should be changed immediately in the event of a breach,
#     with an annual expiration as a backstop.
#
# NOTE: Password expiration and forced changes must be configured in the appropriate
#       account management and PAM modules (e.g. pam_unix). This file does not set an expiration.
#
# [5.1.4] Deny list and password history:
#   - New passwords will be checked against a deny list of at least 20 common or weak passwords.
#   - The system should also remember and reject the previous 5 passwords.
#
# The “dictcheck” option enables checking passwords against a dictionary.
dictcheck = 1
#
# “remember” indicates the number of previous passwords to remember.
remember = 5
#
# [5.1.4] Enforce a minimum interval of one day between password changes.
#
# NOTE: The delay between password changes should be enforced via the PAM configuration for
#       password management (for example, by setting password history rules in pam_unix).
#
# [5.1.5] Session inactivity lock:
#   - Current sessions should be locked after 15 minutes (or less) of inactivity.
#
# NOTE: This requirement must be implemented within session management (e.g. via screen locking tools
#       or PAM session modules), not in pwquality.conf.
#
# [5.1.6] Account lockout and throttling:
#   - Temporary lockout (15 minutes or more) after five consecutive failed login attempts.
#   - Time-doubling throttling (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, etc. minutes) between retries
#     and a permanent lockout after 12 retries.
#
# NOTE: These settings are to be configured in the authentication modules (e.g. pam_faillock)
#       rather than in this file.
#
# [5.1.7] Monitor and alert key personnel when failed logins reach the limit.
#
# NOTE: Monitoring and alerting must be set up in separate security/monitoring systems.
#
# [5.1.8] Automatically suspend accounts after 45 days without a valid login.
#
# NOTE: Account suspension is managed by external account management tools.
#
# [5.1.9] Do not allow user-defined password hints at login.
#
# NOTE: The prohibition of login hints should be enforced in the login manager configuration.
#
# End of /etc/security/pwquality.conf
