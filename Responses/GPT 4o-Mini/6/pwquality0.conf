# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# Policy Note:
# • MFA is enforced wherever possible (see 2.1). For MFA-enabled accounts the minimum
#   password length is 8 characters; for password‐only accounts the minimum is 14.
#   This file’s “minlen” applies to password‐only accounts. MFA-enabled accounts
#   should have their lesser requirement set in the corresponding PAM configuration.
#
# • Maximum password length is not limited here – system constraints apply.
#
# • All character types are allowed. However, for password‐only accounts at least one
#   non‐alphabetic character (digit or punctuation) must be included.
#   (Note: pwquality cannot conditionally enforce this; additional PAM configuration
#   may be required to check for a non‐alphabetic character in password‐only contexts.)
#
# • A password recorded as “breached” should be changed immediately and must expire at
#   least annually. This expiration policy is enforced via shadow or PAM modules, not here.
#
# • New passwords are checked against an internal deny list of weak or previously used
#   passwords. Here we enable a dictionary check against a file containing at least 20
#   common passwords and bad words. (The previous-5-password check and delay of at least one day
#   must be enforced in pam_pwhistory.)
#
# • Account/session policies (inactivity lock [15 minutes or less], temporary lockout after
#   5 failed attempts with exponential delay and a permanent lockout after 12 retries, alerting
#   on repeated failures, automatic suspension after 45 days without a valid login, and
#   disallowing user-defined password hints) are managed by other PAM/system modules.
#

# Minimum acceptable size for the new password (applies to password‐only accounts)
minlen = 14

# Do not limit the maximum password length; system maximum applies

# Require at least one non‐alphabetic character.
# (By requiring at least one digit, non‐alphabetic content is enforced.
#  For a symmetric check including punctuation as an alternative, supplemental PAM rules may be required.)
dcredit = -1

# Enable dictionary check against a custom deny list.
dictcheck = 1
dictpath = /etc/security/bad-passwords.txt

# Additional notes:
# • Password expiration and history (e.g. “change immediately on breach,” annual expiration,
#   and preventing reuse of the last 5 passwords with a one‐day change delay) must be configured
#   via PAM modules (such as pam_unix and pam_pwhistory) and shadow file settings.
#
# • Similarly, inactivity session lockout and account lockout/throttling features are implemented
#   using dedicated PAM modules and system-level security utilities.
