# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This configuration file is intended to help enforce password quality requirements.
#
# NOTE: Some of the following policies (e.g., MFA, password expiration,
# account lockout, session locking, password reuse, notifications, and auto-suspension)
# must be implemented via PAM modules, account management tools, or system policies.
#
# 2.1 MFA: It is strongly recommended to use multi-factor authentication wherever possible.
#      (Configure MFA in the appropriate PAM and authentication settings.)
#
# 5.1.1 Minimum Password Lengths:
#      - For password‐only accounts: enforce a minimum length of 14 characters.
#      - For MFA-enabled accounts: enforce a minimum of 8 characters.
#      NOTE: This file is applied to password‐only accounts.
minlen = 14
#
#      Maximum password length: Do not limit the upper bound here.
#      (System constraints will apply if necessary.)
#
# 5.1.2 Character Types:
#      Allow all character types. For password‐only accounts require at least one non‐alphabetic
#      character (e.g., a digit or symbol). Since pwquality cannot enforce an “either/or” rule
#      for non‐alphabetic characters, one approach is to require at least one digit.
dcredit = -1
#
# 5.1.3 Immediate Password Change on Breach and Annual Expiration:
#      These rules must be enforced by account management policies (for example via pam_unix
#      and shadow file settings) rather than via pwquality.
#
# 5.1.4 Password Deny List and Password History:
#      On new password creation, check against an internal deny list (at least 20 common weak
#      passwords) and the previous 5 passwords.
#      Also, enforce a minimum delay of 1 day between password changes.
#      (These functions are implemented using pam_pwhistory or similar mechanisms, not in this file.)
#
# 5.1.5 Session Inactivity Lock:
#      Lock the current session after 15 minutes (or less) of inactivity.
#      (This is typically configured in the session manager or via PAM session modules.)
#
# 5.1.6 Account Lockout and Throttling:
#      - Temporarily lock an account for at least 15 minutes after 5 consecutive failed logins.
#      - Use time-doubling throttling (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, … minutes) between retries,
#        with permanent lockout (IT reset required) after 12 retries.
#      (These require configuration in the authentication stack, not here.)
#
# 5.1.7 Alerting on Repeated Failed Logins:
#      Monitor and alert key personnel when failed login attempts reach the configured limit.
#      (Implement via system auditing and alerting tools.)
#
# 5.1.8 Automatic Account Suspension:
#      Automatically suspend an account after 45 days without a valid login.
#      (This policy must be enforced in the account management framework.)
#
# 5.1.9 Disallow User-defined Password Hints:
#      Prevent users from setting password hints at login.
#      (This is managed in the authentication interface, not in pwquality.)
#
# Additional pwquality settings:
#
# Enable dictionary check against a wordlist of common (and weak) passwords.
