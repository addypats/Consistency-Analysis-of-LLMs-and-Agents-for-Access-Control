# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file provides parameters for enforcing password quality
# to the extent possible via pam_pwquality. Several of the rules
# (e.g., MFA enforcement, session lockout, password history, account
# suspension, throttling of failed logins, and alerting) must be implemented
# via additional system or PAM configuration.
#
# Rule 2.1: Use MFA wherever possible.
#   (Note: MFA settings are managed outside of this file.)
#
# Rule 5.1.1: Enforce minimum password lengths.
#   • Password‐only accounts: Minimum length of 14 characters.
#   • MFA-enabled accounts: Minimum length of 8 characters.
# Since pam_pwquality.conf cannot conditionally apply rules based on MFA status,
# use the stricter setting here. For MFA-enabled accounts, a separate profile
# or PAM configuration might be used.
minlen = 14
# Maximum password length is not limited (system constraints apply).
#
# Rule 5.1.2: Allow all character types but require that passwords include
# at least one character that is non‐alphabetic.
# Enforcing at least two character classes (one of which must be non-alphabetic)
# achieves this requirement.
minclass = 2
#
# Rule 5.1.3: Set password expiration to force a change immediately in the
# event of a breach with an annual expiration as a backstop.
# (Note: Expiration policies must be handled via account management systems;
# they cannot be set in this file.)
#
# Rule 5.1.4: Check new passwords against a deny list:
#   • The deny list contains at least 20 of the most common weak passwords.
#   • Additionally, previous 5 passwords should not be re-used.
# (Note: Password history checks and enforced minimum delay between changes
# are configured via PAM (e.g. pam_unix's "remember" and "mindays" options).)
dictcheck = 1
dictpath = /etc/security/denylist.txt
#
# Rule 5.1.5: Lock the current session after 15 minutes (or less) of inactivity.
# (Note: This is enforced through session managers or screensaver/idle timeout settings.)
#
# Rule 5.1.6: Enforce temporary account lockout and exponential time doubling
# between failed login attempts:
#   • Lockout after 5 consecutive failures for 15 minutes (or more).
#   • Doubling delay between each retry (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, … minutes).
#   • Permanent lockout after 12 retries (requires IT administrative reset).
# (Note: Such controls need to be implemented using PAM's faillock or equivalent modules.)
#
# Rule 5.1.7: Monitor and alert key personnel when bad login attempts hit the defined limit.
# (Note: This needs to be configured in the system's monitoring and alerting tools.)
#
# Rule 5.1.8: Automatically suspend accounts after 45 days without a valid login.
# (Note: Account suspension policies should be enforced by the account management system.)
#
# Rule 5.1.9: Do not allow user-defined password hints at login.
# (Note: This is enforced by the authentication interface and user management settings.)
