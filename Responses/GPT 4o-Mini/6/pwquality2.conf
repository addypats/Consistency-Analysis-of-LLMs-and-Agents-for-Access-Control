# /etc/security/pwquality.conf - Password quality configuration file
#
# Rule 2.1: Use MFA wherever possible.
#   (MFA integration is handled in the PAM/authentication stack rather than here.)
#
# Rule 5.1.1: Enforce minimum password lengths:
#   - For MFA-enabled accounts, require a minimum length of 8 characters.
#   - For password-only accounts, require a minimum length of 14 characters.
# Since conditional settings aren’t supported in this file, set the default minimum
# to 8 (for MFA-enabled accounts) and enforce stricter checks for password-only accounts
# via additional PAM or application logic.
minlen = 8
#
# Rule 5.1.1: Do not impose an artificial maximum on password length.
# This file does not limit maximum length; system constraints apply.
#
# Rule 5.1.2: Accept all character types, but for password-only accounts require
# at least one non-alphabetic character.
# The following setting ensures at least one “other” (non-alphabetic) character is used.
ocredit = -1
#
# Rule 5.1.3: Force immediate password changes following a breach,
# with annual expiration as a backstop.
# (Password aging and forced change policies are managed in /etc/shadow and via PAM modules.)
#
# Rule 5.1.4: Check new passwords against a deny list of known bad or weak passwords
# (with at least 20 common examples) and against the previous 5 passwords.
# Enable dictionary checking and specify the deny list file.
dictcheck = 1
badwords_file = /etc/security/badpasswords
# (Password history and minimum change delay of 1 day are enforced using additional PAM configuration.)
#
# Rule 5.1.5: Lock the current session after 15 minutes (or less) of inactivity.
# (Session timeout is configured via desktop/shell settings, not here.)
#
# Rule 5.1.6: Temporarily lock the account for at least 15 minutes after 5 consecutive
# failed login attempts, with exponential (time-doubling) throttling between retries,
# and impose a permanent lockout (requiring IT intervention) after 12 retries.
# (These account lockout policies are applied via PAM modules such as pam_faillock.)
#
# Rule 5.1.7: Monitor and alert key personnel when the failed login attempts reach the limit.
# (System monitoring and alerting are handled by separate security monitoring tools.)
#
# Rule 5.1.8: Automatically suspend an account following 45 days of inactivity.
# (This account suspension policy is enforced externally through system or cron-based mechanisms.)
#
# Rule 5.1.9: Disallow user-defined password hints at login.
# (This is handled in the login and PAM configuration and not via the pwquality settings.)
