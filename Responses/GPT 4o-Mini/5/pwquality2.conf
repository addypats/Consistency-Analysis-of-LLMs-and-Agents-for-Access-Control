# The following parameters enforce password composition requirements.
#
# Ensure passwords/passphrases have a minimum length of 12 characters.
minlen = 12
#
# Ensure that at least one digit is present (numeric requirement).
dcredit = -1
#
# Ensure that at least one lowercase letter is present (alphabetic requirement).
lcredit = -1
#
# ============================================================================
# POLICY REMINDERS (to be enforced via other system and PAM configurations):
#
# • Change vendor-supplied defaults (passwords/settings) and remove or disable
#   unnecessary default accounts before installing a system on the network.
#
# • Remove or disable inactive user accounts within 90 days.
#
# • Limit repeated access attempts by locking out a user ID after no more than
#   six unsuccessful attempts.
#
# • Set the lockout duration to a minimum of 30 minutes or until an administrator
#   re-enables the user ID.
#
# • Require re-authentication if a session has been idle for more than 15 minutes.
#
# • Enforce periodic password changes (e.g., at least once every 90 days).
#
# • Prevent reuse of the last four passwords/passphrases.
#
# • Set passwords for first-time use (or after a reset) to a unique value and require
#   an immediate change upon first login.
#
# • Authenticate user access with one or more methods (password/passphrase, biometric,
#   smart card, or authentication token) with appropriate encryption during transmission
#   and storage.
#
# • For invalid authentication attempts, lock the account after no more than 10 tries,
#   with a lockout duration of at least 30 minutes or until the user’s identity is confirmed.
#
# • Update passwords immediately if there is any suspicion or knowledge that they have
#   been compromised.
#
# • Implement and enforce MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) for access into the CDE
#   and for all remote access, and document all MFA access.
#
# • Ensure passwords are not hardcoded in scripts and are changed periodically.
#
# Note: Many of these policies (account inactivity, lockouts, password history,
# expiration, session re-authentication, MFA, etc.) must be configured in the appropriate
# PAM, account management, or application-specific files and are not directly controlled
# via pwquality.
