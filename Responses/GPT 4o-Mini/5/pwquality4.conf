# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file is used to configure the password quality requirements enforced by the PAM modules.
# Note: Some of the requirements from the overall security policy (e.g.,
#       vendor default removal, account inactivity removal, login lockout, idle session re-authentication,
#       password aging, MFA, password history enforcement, etc.) must be implemented via other system
#       or PAM configurations (such as in /etc/security/pwhistory.conf, /etc/pam.d/*, or system management tools).
#
# Enforced password quality requirements:
#
# 1. Passwords/passphrases must have a minimum length of 12 characters.
# 2. They must include both numeric and alphabetic characters; this configuration requires:
#    - At least one digit (dcredit = -1)
#    - At least one lowercase letter (lcredit = -1)
#    - At least one uppercase letter (ucredit = -1)
#
# Note: Although one line of policy calls for a minimum of 7 characters, the stronger control of 12 characters 
# is being enforced here.
#
# The following settings apply:

minlen = 12
dcredit = -1
lcredit = -1
ucredit = -1

# Additional security measures (not handled via pwquality.conf) must include:
#
# - Changing vendor-supplied defaults and disabling unnecessary default accounts.
# - Removing or disabling inactive user accounts within 90 days.
# - Locking out user IDs after 6 or 10 invalid authentication attempts with a lockout duration of at least 30 minutes (or until an administrator intervenes).
# - Requiring re-authentication if a session is idle for more than 15 minutes.
# - Enforcing password change every 90 days.
# - Preventing reuse of the last four passwords/passphrases.
# - Setting unique temporary passwords for first-time logins or resets.
# - Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all access, with encryption in transmission and storage.
# - Ensuring passwords are not hardcoded in scripts and are periodically changed.
#
# Be sure to review and implement these controls using the appropriate PAM modules and system management settings.
