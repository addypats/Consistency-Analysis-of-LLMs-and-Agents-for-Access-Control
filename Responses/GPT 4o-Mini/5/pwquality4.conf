# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file contains settings for password quality control.
# Note: Several of the recommended policies (e.g. account lockout,
# inactivity removal, password aging/history, MFA enforcement, etc.)
# are implemented via other mechanisms (PAM modules, account management tools,
# system scripts, etc.) and are noted here for completeness.
#
# Vendor-supplied defaults should be replaced and unnecessary default
# accounts removed or disabled prior to system installation.
#
# Inactive user accounts should be removed/disabled within 90 days.
#
# Repeated failed authentication attempts (more than 6, or up to 10 as noted)
# and lockout durations (minimum 30 minutes or until an administrator resets) are
# also managed outside of this file.
#
# Sessions idle for more than 15 minutes should require re-authentication.
#
# Password aging policies – such as forcing a change at least every 90 days,
# and ensuring first-time or reset passwords are unique and changed after first use –
# must be enforced via appropriate account management configurations.
#
# Multi-factor authentication (MFA) must be implemented and all authentication
# credentials (passwords, biometrics, smart cards, tokens) encrypted during
# transmission and storage.
#
# Hardcoding passwords in scripts is disallowed and passwords must be periodically changed.
#
# The settings below address the password composition requirements:
#
# 1. Passwords/passphrases must have a minimum length of 12 characters and must contain
#    both numeric and alphabetic characters.
#
# 2. (Alternate policy note: some policies indicate a minimum length of 7 characters;
#    choose the stronger requirement that is applicable to your environment.)
#

# Minimum password length (choose the stronger requirement: 12 characters)
minlen = 12

# Require at least one digit.
# Negative values mean “at least N digits are required”.
dcredit = -1

# Require at least one lowercase letter (to satisfy the alphabetic component).
lcredit = -1

# ucredit can be set to 0 or negative if you wish to require uppercase letters;
# it is left at 0 here as the policy only requires numeric and alphabetic characters.
ucredit = 0

# Ensure that at least two different character types (digit, lower, upper, or other)
# are present in the password.
minclass = 2

# Note: The settings below (such as password history to avoid re-use of the last 4 passwords)
# and the enforcement of more granular controls (e.g., immediate change after first login)
# are generally managed by PAM modules like pam_pwhistory and are not configured in pwquality.conf.
#
# End of /etc/security/pwquality.conf
