# NOTE:
# The following security policies must be implemented via other
# PAM modules or system configuration, as they cannot be enforced 
# through pwquality.conf:
#
# - Changing vendor-supplied defaults and disabling unnecessary default accounts (2.1).
# - Removing or disabling inactive user accounts within 90 days (8.1.4).
# - Limiting repeated access attempts and specifying lockout policies (8.1.6, 8.1.7, 8.3.4).
# - Re-authentication on sessions idle for more than 15 minutes (8.1.8).
# - Password change frequency and history (change every 90 days, no reuse of last four passwords) (8.2.4, 8.2.5, 8.2.6, 8.3.7, 8.3.8).
# - Secondary authentication methods (MFA, biometrics, smart cards, tokens) with encrypted transmission (8.3.1, 8.4.1-8.5.1).
# - Preventing hardcoded passwords in scripts and periodic password updates (8.6.2, 8.6.3).
