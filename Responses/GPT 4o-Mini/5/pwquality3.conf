# This file configures password quality requirements.
# Note: Many of the policies below (e.g., vendor defaults, inactive account removal,
# account lockout, idle session re‐authentication, password history, MFA, and
# non-hardcoded passwords in scripts) must be enforced via other system tools
# and PAM modules (such as pam_pwhistory, pam_faillock/pam_tally2, session timeout
# settings, etc.). These are noted here for reference only.
#
# Policy Requirement:
# • Passwords/passphrases must have a minimum length of 12 characters.
# • Passwords must contain both numeric and alphabetic characters.
#
minlen = 12
#
# Require at least one digit; a negative value forces inclusion.
dcredit = -1
#
# Require at least one lowercase letter to ensure alphabetic characters are used.
lcredit = -1
#
# (Optional) Uncomment the next line to also require an uppercase letter.
# ucredit = -1
#
# Other policies referenced:
#
# - Change vendor-supplied defaults and disable unnecessary accounts before system installation.
#   [Handled during system hardening and account provisioning.]
#
# - Remove or disable inactive user accounts within 90 days.
#   [Configured in account and session management, not in pwquality.conf.]
#
# - Limit authentication attempts and set lockout duration to at least 30 minutes.
#   [Implemented via PAM modules (e.g., pam_faillock or pam_tally2) and not here.]
#
# - Force re-authentication after 15 minutes of idle session.
#   [Managed by session timeout settings in your display manager/console configuration.]
#
# - Require a password change at least once every 90 days;
#   prevent reuse of the last 4 passwords;
#   and ensure first-time use/reset passwords are unique and re-set on first login.
#   [These are implemented using pam_pwhistory and related PAM configuration options.]
#
# - Enforce encryption of authentication tokens (passwords, biometrics, smart cards).
#   [This is a broader system requirement beyond pwquality.conf.]
#
# - Do not hardcode passwords in scripts and require periodic changes.
#   [Handled by secure coding practices and change management policies.]
#
# End of /etc/security/pwquality.conf
