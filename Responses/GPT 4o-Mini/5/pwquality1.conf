# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This configuration file is intended to enforce the password quality aspects
# of our overall password policy. Note that many of the additional security
# controls (e.g. changing vendor defaults, disabling inactive accounts, account
# lockout settings, idle session re-authentication, MFA, unique initial passwords,
# periodic password change frequency, password history, and prohibiting hardcoded
# passwords) must be implemented in other system files (such as PAM configuration,
# system management scripts, or via account management tools) and are not handled
# by the pwquality configuration.
#
# The settings below enforce the following applicable policy requirements:
#
# • Passwords/passphrases must have a minimum length of 12 characters.
# • Passwords must contain at least one numeric character and one alphabetic character.
#
# (Other requirements from the policy – such as account lockout after repeated attempts,
# account inactivity management, session re-authentication after idle time, MFA enforcement,
# preventing reuse of the last four passwords, and so on – need to be configured in their
# corresponding subsystems.)
#
# Minimum required size for the new password.
minlen = 12
#
# Require at least one digit. A negative value means a minimum of that many digits.
dcredit = -1
#
# Require at least one lowercase alphabetic character.
lcredit = -1
#
# Note: If you wish to require an uppercase character as well, you may uncomment the line below.
# ucredit = -1
