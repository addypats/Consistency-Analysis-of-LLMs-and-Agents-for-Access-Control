# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file contains configuration settings for password quality enforcement.
# Note: Many of the overall system password and account policies (e.g.,
# account lockouts, inactivity removal, session re-authentication, MFA, password
# history, expiration, and first‐time/reset password requirements) must be enforced
# via other PAM modules or system configuration. Only those settings that can be
# enforced by pwquality are included below.
#
# Rule 6 (8.3.6): Passwords/passphrases must have a minimum length of 12 characters
# and must contain both numeric and alphabetic characters.
# (In this configuration, a minimum length of 12 is set.)
minlen = 12
#
# To help ensure that passwords contain both numeric and alphabetic characters,
# negative values are used for the following credit parameters (each negative value
# forces at least one character of the appropriate type):
#
# dcredit: Require at least one digit.
dcredit = -1
#
# ucredit: Require at least one uppercase letter.
ucredit = -1
#
# lcredit: Require at least one lowercase letter.
lcredit = -1
#
# NOTE:
# - Rule 7 (8.2.3) suggests a minimum length of 7 characters for some accounts;
#   however, the stricter requirement of 12 characters prevails.
#
# The following policies, though required by the overall security policy, are not
# managed by pwquality and must be implemented elsewhere (for example, via PAM modules,
# account management scripts, or other system configuration files):
#
#  • Always change vendor-supplied defaults and remove/disable unnecessary default accounts.
#  • Remove or disable inactive user accounts within 90 days.
#  • Limit repeated access attempts: lock out after six attempts (or as specified)
#    and set the lockout duration to at least 30 minutes or until an administrator re-enables the account.
#  • Require re-authentication after 15 minutes of idle session time.
#  • Enforce user password change at least once every 90 days.
#  • Prevent reuse of any of the last four passwords/passphrases.
#  • Set unique, temporary passwords for first-time use and upon reset (requiring change immediately).
#  • Enforce multi-factor authentication and ensure that all authentication mechanisms are encrypted.
#  • Lock out an account after not more than 10 invalid authentication attempts.
#  • Require a password change if there is any suspicion that the password has been compromised.
#  • Ensure that passwords are not hardcoded in scripts and are periodically changed.
#
# Be sure that these additional rules are configured appropriately via the associated
# PAM modules (e.g., pam_pwhistory, pam_faillock) and system security policies.
