# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file provides password quality settings. Note that many of the
# overall system and account security policies must be enforced via
# other mechanisms (e.g., account lockout, password history, inactivity
# removal, MFA, session reauthentication, etc.). The settings below
# apply only to password composition and do not cover:
#
# • Vendor-supplied default credentials/settings
# • Inactive account removal (e.g., within 90 days)
# • Lockout after repeated failed authentication attempts
# • Idle session timeout requiring re-authentication
# • Mandatory password change intervals (e.g., every 90 days)
# • Password history (disallow reuse of the last four passwords)
# • Temporary passwords for first-time use or resets
# • Multi-factor authentication and secure transmission/storage of credentials
# • Hardcoded passwords in scripts and periodic password change enforcement
#
# The following settings enforce a policy where passwords/passphrases:
# • Have a minimum length of 12 characters
# • Must contain both numeric and alphabetic characters
#
minlen = 12
# Require at least one digit (negative values require that many digits)
dcredit = -1
# Require at least one uppercase letter
ucredit = -1
# Require at least one lowercase letter
lcredit = -1
# Ensure that at least three distinct character classes (e.g., digit, uppercase,
# lowercase, or other) are used in the password
minclass = 3
