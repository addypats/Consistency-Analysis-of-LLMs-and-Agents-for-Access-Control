# Note:
# - There is no option in pwquality.conf to distinguish between subscriber-chosen
#   secrets and randomly generated ones (with a shorter minimum length).
# - Other aspects of the policy (e.g., normalization using NFKC/NFKD, collapsing multiple spaces,
#   rate limiting of authentication failures, and ensuring no hints are stored) must be implemented
#   within the authentication application or system and are not handled by pwquality.
# - pwquality will accept all ASCII printing characters (and if supported, Unicode) without further checks.
# - No truncation is performed; each Unicode code point is counted as a single character.
# - No arbitrary composition rules (such as requiring mixtures of character types or prohibiting
#   sequential or repeated characters) are imposed.
