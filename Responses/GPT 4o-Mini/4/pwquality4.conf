# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This configuration enforces the following policy for subscriber‐chosen memorized secrets:
# • Must be at least 8 characters in length (subscribers may choose up to 64 characters).
# • No additional composition (complexity) rules (e.g., requiring mixtures of letter cases,
#   digits, or special characters) are imposed.
# • The candidate secret will be checked against a blacklist (e.g., commonly-used, expected, or 
#   compromised values such as breach corpuses, dictionary words, and sequential or repetitive 
#   characters). If found, the user is required to choose a different secret.
#
# Note:
# • Auto‐generated secrets (if applicable), may use a minimum length of 6 characters.
# • All printing ASCII characters (plus space) and Unicode characters are acceptable.
#   Normalization of Unicode (using NFKC or NFKD) should be applied by the surrounding application
#   layer before hashing the password.
# • Rate limiting of authentication attempts is implemented elsewhere (e.g., via PAM or login 
#   security mechanisms).
#
# Enforce a minimum length of 8 characters (for subscriber‑chosen secrets)

# Permit secrets up to 64 characters in length

# Do not require a mix of character classes; allow any printable ASCII or Unicode characters.
