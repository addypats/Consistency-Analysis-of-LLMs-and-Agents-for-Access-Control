# UNICODE HANDLING:
# For passwords containing Unicode characters, it is recommended that the application/endpoint
# normalize the string using NFKC or NFKD normalization (per UAX 15) before further processing.
# This file does not perform normalization; that must be handled externally.

# RATE LIMITING:
# Enforcement of rate limiting for failed authentication attempts is the responsibility of the authentication system.
# This configuration file does not implement rate limiting.
