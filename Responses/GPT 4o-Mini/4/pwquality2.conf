# The application layer is responsible for counting Unicode code points,
# normalizing input using NFKC or NFKD, and for ensuring no truncation occurs.

# No additional complexity requirements (such as mixtures of character types
# or disallowing sequential/repeating characters) are imposed here.

# Disable extra complexity checks by not requiring extra character classes.

# Additional guidance:
#   - All printing ASCII characters and the space character are acceptable.
#   - Unicode characters are acceptable; normalization should be handled by the verifier.
#   - The module does not impose hints or require the use of preset personal questions.
#
# Rate limiting of failed authentication attempts MUST be implemented by the service/PAM,
# not by the password quality module.
