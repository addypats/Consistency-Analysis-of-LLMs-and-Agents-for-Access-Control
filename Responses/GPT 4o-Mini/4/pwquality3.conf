# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This configuration enforces the following guidelines for subscriber‐chosen memorized secrets:
#
#  • Must be at least 8 characters long.
#  • May be up to 64 characters in length.
#  • No additional composition rules (such as requiring digits, uppercase, lowercase, or special characters)
#    are imposed.
#  • Secrets are checked against a blacklist of known compromised or commonly used values.
#
# Note:
#  • Memorized secrets chosen randomly by the CSP or verifier (outside of this configuration)
#    may have a minimum length of 6 characters.
#  • All printing ASCII and Unicode characters are acceptable. Handling of normalization (NFKC or NFKD)
#    and any allowance for multiple consecutive spaces should be managed externally.
#  • Rate limiting of authentication attempts and prevention of storing or prompting for hints are not
#    part of this configuration.
