# This configuration implements the following policy:
# - Subscriber-chosen memorized secrets MUST be at least 8 characters.
# - Subscriber-chosen secrets MAY be as long as 64 characters.
# - No additional composition or complexity rules (digit, case, special characters, etc.)
#   are imposed.
# - A dictionary (blacklist) check is enabled to prevent the use of commonly-used,
#   expected, or compromised passwords.
#
# Note: Other aspects such as Unicode normalization and rate-limiting of failed
# authentication attempts MUST be handled externally by the application.

# Do not perform any automatic truncation or substitution of whitespace.
# All normalization (e.g., via NFKC or NFKD) should be applied by the verifier before hashing.
