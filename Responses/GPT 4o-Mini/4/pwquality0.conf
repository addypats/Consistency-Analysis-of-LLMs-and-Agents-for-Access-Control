# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This configuration enforces the following policy for subscriber‐chosen memorized secrets:
#
# • The new password must be at least 8 characters long.
# • Passwords may be as long as 64 characters (i.e. verifiers should permit at least 64 characters);
#   no truncation or upper‐limit check is imposed here.
# • No additional composition rules are enforced (e.g. no required mix of character classes,
#   and consecutive repeating characters are allowed).
# • A dictionary (or blacklist) check is enabled to reject commonly used,
#   expected, or compromised values.
# • All printing ASCII characters and Unicode characters are acceptable.
#   Any Unicode normalization (NFKC or NFKD) should be applied by the authenticator.
#
# Minimum length for subscriber-chosen memorized secrets.
minlen = 8

# Note on maximum length:
# While verifiers SHOULD allow at least 64 characters,
# this file does not impose an upper limit so that long passwords are accepted.

# Do not enforce additional composition rules. Setting all credit values to 0
# avoids requiring mixtures of digits, uppercase, lowercase, or special characters.
dcredit = 0
ucredit = 0
lcredit = 0
ocredit = 0

# Do not disallow consecutive repeated characters.
# (A value of 0 disables the check for repeated characters.)
maxrepeat = 0

# Enable check against a dictionary file that contains commonly used,
# expected, or compromised memorized secrets.
dictcheck = 1
# Path to the dictionary file (adjust if necessary for your system).
dictpath = /usr/share/cracklib/pw_dict

# End of file.
