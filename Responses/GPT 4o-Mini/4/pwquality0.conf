# Note:
# - While subscriber-chosen secrets must be at least 8 characters, this configuration
#   makes no attempt to restrict passwords beyond enforcing that minimum length.
# - Memorized secrets up to 64 characters SHOULD be permitted. Enforcement of a maximum
#   length is not directly controlled here.
# - All printing ASCII and Unicode characters (including space) are accepted.
# - It is expected that any Unicode input is normalized (e.g., via NFKC or NFKD)
#   by the verifier prior to further processing.
# - Rate limiting for failed authentication attempts and prevention of storing hints
#   are responsibilities of the overall authentication system, not enforced by this file.
