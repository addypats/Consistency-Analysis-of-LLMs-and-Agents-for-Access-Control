# This is not directly configurable in pwquality.conf, it requires additional authentication mechanisms and configurations outside of this file to achieve MFA (8.3.1, 8.4.1-8.5.1)
# Similarly, 8.6.2 and 8.6.3 about hardcoded passwords and scripts require coding practices and separate security measures, not settings in this file.
