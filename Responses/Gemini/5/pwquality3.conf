# Minimum password length
minlen = 12

# Minimum number of different character classes
dcredit = 2

# Minimum number of digits
difok = 2

# Number of previous passwords to remember
remember = 4

# Password reuse interval (in days)

# Enforce password changes every 90 days

# Lockout after a number of invalid login attempts

#These settings are added to address additional requirements not directly covered by pwquality.conf, but crucial for overall security
#Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enforced via separate mechanisms outside the scope of this configuration file.
#Hardcoded passwords in scripts are prevented by secure coding practices and regular security audits.  This configuration file cannot directly enforce this.
