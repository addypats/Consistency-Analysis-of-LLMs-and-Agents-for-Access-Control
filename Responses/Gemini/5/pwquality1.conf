# Session timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity.  (Requires external mechanisms)
# This configuration file alone cannot enforce this.  Requires PAM configuration.


#  The following settings address requirements that cannot be fully enforced by pwquality alone.
#  They require additional mechanisms like PAM, auditing, and MFA solutions.

# Multi-factor authentication (MFA) - Requires external MFA solution integration.
# Password storage and transmission encryption - Requires secure system design and encryption tools.
# Hardcoded passwords in scripts - Requires code review and secure coding practices.  
#  pwquality cannot enforce this directly.

# Note:  Items like "Remove/disable inactive user accounts within 90 days", "Authenticate user access to assets with at least one of the following methods", and others rely on system administration practices and external tools beyond the scope of this configuration file.
