# Configuration for the pam_pwquality module
#
# The pam_pwquality module is used to check the strength of new passwords.
# It can enforce rules such as minimum length, requiring specific character types,
# and checking for repeated characters.

# Minimum length for the new password.
# From rule 8.3.6: "Passwords/passphrases must have a minimum length of 12 characters"
minlen = 12

# Require at least one digit in the new password.
# From rule 8.3.6: "must contain both numeric and alphabetic characters"
dcredit = -1

# Require at least one uppercase character in the new password.
# From rule 8.3.6: "must contain both numeric and alphabetic characters"
ucredit = -1

# Require at least one lowercase character in the new password.
# From rule 8.3.6: "must contain both numeric and alphabetic characters"
lcredit = -1

# The following rules are part of the policy but are NOT directly configurable
# within /etc/security/pwquality.conf. They typically involve settings in
# /etc/login.defs, /etc/pam.d/* files (e.g., pam_faillock, pam_pwhistory, pam_unix),
# or operational procedures.

# 1. Always change vendor-supplied defaults (passwords and settings) and remove
#    or disable unnecessary default accounts before installing a system on the
#    network (see 2.1).
#    -> Operational procedure.

# 2. Remove/disable inactive user accounts within 90 days (see 8.1.4).
#    -> Account management policy (e.g., cron jobs, chage, LDAP).

# 3. Limit repeated access attempts by locking out the user ID after not more
#    than six attempts (see 8.1.6).
#    -> Configured in /etc/pam.d/system-auth and /etc/pam.d/password-auth using pam_faillock.so (deny=6).

# 4. Set the lockout duration to a minimum of 30 minutes or until an
#    administrator enables the user ID (see 8.1.7).
#    -> Configured in /etc/pam.d/system-auth and /etc/pam.d/password-auth using pam_faillock.so (unlock_time=1800).

# 5. If a session has been idle for more than 15 minutes, require the user to
#    re-authenticate to re-activate the terminal or session (see 8.1.8).
#    -> Configured via TMOUT environment variable in shell profiles or screen locker settings.

# 6. Change user passwords at least once every 90 days (see 8.2.4).
#    -> Configured in /etc/login.defs (PASS_MAX_DAYS) or using 'chage'.

# 7. Do not allow an individual to submit a new password that is the same as any
#    of the last four passwords/passphrases they have used (see 8.2.5).
#    -> Configured in /etc/pam.d/system-auth and /etc/pam.d/password-auth using pam_pwhistory.so (remember=4).

# 8. Set passwords for first-time use and upon reset to a unique value for each
#    user, and change immediately after the first use (see 8.2.6).
#    -> Operational procedure (e.g., 'chage -d 0').

# 9. Authenticate user access to assets with at least one of the following methods:
#    password or a passphrase, any biometric method, Smart Card, or an authentication
#    token. These authentication mechanisms must be encrypted during transmission
#    and storage. (see 8.3.1.)
#    -> General authentication system design and implementation.

# 10. Invalid authentication attempts are limited by: Locking out the user ID
#     after not more than 10 attempts. Setting the lockout duration to a minimum
#     of 30 minutes or until the user’s identity is confirmed. (See 8.3.4)
#     -> (Note: Rule 8.1.6 specifies 6 attempts, which is more stringent; 6 attempts would be used.)
#     -> Configured in /etc/pam.d/system-auth and /etc/pam.d/password-auth using pam_faillock.so (deny=6, unlock_time=1800).

# 11. Change passwords/passphrases if there is any suspicion or knowledge that the
#     password/passphrases have been compromised. (See 8.3.8)
#     -> Operational and incident response procedure.

# 12. Implement and enforce MFA across all access into the CDE and for all remote
#     access and document all MFA access (8.4.1 to 8.5.1)
#     -> Authentication system design and implementation (e.g., pam_google_authenticator).

# 13. Passwords must not be hardcoded on scripts and must be periodically changed (8.6.2,8.6.3)
#     -> Secure coding practices and operational procedures for service accounts.
