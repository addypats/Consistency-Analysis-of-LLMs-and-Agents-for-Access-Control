# This file is used by the pwquality command to enforce password quality.
# See pwquality(8) for details on the parameters.

# Minimum password length (characters)
minlen = 12

# Minimum number of different character classes required.
#  0 = any character
#  1 = upper and lower case, or upper and digits, or lower and digits
#  2 = upper and lower and digits, upper and lower and symbols, ...
#  3 = upper, lower, digits, and symbols

# This is more restrictive than the requirement of 7 characters and will override it. 

# Lockout settings (these settings are not directly configurable in pwquality, require PAM configuration)
# lockout_attempts = 6  (See PAM configuration for lockout settings)
# lockout_time = 1800 (See PAM configuration for lockout time, 30 minutes = 1800 seconds)


# Idle timeout settings (these settings are not directly configurable in pwquality, require PAM configuration)
# idle_timeout = 900 (See PAM configuration,  15 minutes = 900 seconds)

# The following are not directly configurable through pwquality.conf; they require additional mechanisms like PAM or separate authentication systems.
# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Requires system-wide MFA implementation beyond the scope of pwquality.
# Encryption of authentication mechanisms:  Requires system-wide encryption implementation beyond the scope of pwquality.
# Password Hardcoding Prevention: Requires secure coding practices and code review, not directly managed by pwquality.
