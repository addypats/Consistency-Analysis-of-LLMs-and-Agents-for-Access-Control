# account lockout, login delay throttling, monitoring, account suspension,
# and password hints) are not included here as they are managed by other
# system components (e.g., PAM stack, desktop environment, login.defs, monitoring tools).

# Require a minimum length of 14 characters for password-only accounts.
# Note: pwquality.conf applies globally and cannot dynamically differentiate
# between MFA-enabled and password-only accounts. Setting minlen=14 ensures
# compliance for password-only accounts, also satisfying the 8-character
# requirement for MFA-enabled accounts with a stricter policy.

# A value of 0 typically means no limit or as long as the system allows.

# This satisfies the requirement for "at least one non-alphabetic character"
# for password-only accounts by enforcing character diversity.
