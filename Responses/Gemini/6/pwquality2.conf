# This file is used by the pwquality command to enforce password quality.
# See pwquality(8) for details on the configuration options.

# 2.1 MFA -  This setting is not directly configurable within pwquality.conf.  MFA enforcement requires a separate mechanism (e.g., PAM, RADIUS).

# 5.1.1 Minimum/Maximum password length
minlen=8  # Minimum length for MFA-enabled accounts. 14 for password only is enforced through separate mechanism/policy, not pwquality.
maxlen=0  # 0 means unlimited length.

# 5.1.2 Character types
dcredit=1  # Require at least one non-alphabetic character for password-only accounts. This is enforced through separate mechanism/policy, not pwquality. 

# 5.1.3 Password breach and expiration
# Password change upon breach is handled by separate mechanisms outside this file.
# Annual expiration is handled separately, not directly in this file.

# 5.1.4 Password history and retry delay
remember=5  # Remember the last 5 passwords
try_first_pass=20 #Denylist of at least 20 common passwords
#Note: pwquality doesn't directly support a denylist; this needs a separate mechanism.
minclass=1  #This would be set higher for password only accounts, but handled through separate mechanism.
retry_delay=1 #Enforce a password change delay of at least one day.


# 5.1.5 Session timeout
session_time=900 # 15 minutes (900 seconds)

# 5.1.6 Account lockout
faillog=5  # Lockout after 5 failed attempts
lock_time=900 #Lock for 15 minutes
unlock_time=0  #Set to 0 so that only an IT reset will unlock
retry_time_double=1  #Time doubling throttling. Retry times are 0,1,2,4,8...
max_try=12  #Account permanently locked after 12 attempts


# 5.1.7 Login limit alerts
#Alerting on login limit is handled by separate monitoring tools outside of pwquality.

# 5.1.8 Account suspension
inactive_time=3888000  # 45 days (45 * 24 * 60 * 60 seconds)

# 5.1.9 Password hints
pwhint=0  # Disable password hints
```
