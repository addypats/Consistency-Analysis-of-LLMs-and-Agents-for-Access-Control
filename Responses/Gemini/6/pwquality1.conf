# pwquality.conf - Password quality configuration file

# 2.1 MFA (handled outside this file, configuration guidelines only)
# Encourage MFA usage wherever possible through separate mechanisms.

# 5.1.1 Minimum and Maximum Password Length
minlen=14  #Default for password-only accounts.  MFA accounts will use a lower minimum.
maxlen=unlimited #System will determine the maximum length based on its constraints


# 5.1.2 Allowed and Required Character Types
dcredit=1 # Require at least one non-alphabetic character for password-only accounts.
uchars=1 #Allow uppercase characters (implicit)
lchars=1 #Allow lowercase characters (implicit)
digits=1 #Allow digits (implicit)
specialchars=1 # Allow special characters (implicit)


# 5.1.3 Password Expiration and Breach Handling
#Immediate password change upon breach is handled externally.
#Annual expiration is a backstop - setting this is considered best practice even with breach detection.
enforce_for=ALL
remember=5
reuse=5
try_first_pass=0
minclass=0
maxclass=0
expiredays=365


# 5.1.4 Password History and Denylist
pwhistory=5 #Prevent reuse of last 5 passwords.
# Denylist configuration (requires external mechanism, this is just guidelines).
# Integrate with a system that maintains a denylist of at least 20 common passwords.
# enforce_denylist=yes (Implementation outside this file)

#Password Change Delay
password_change_delay=1

# 5.1.5 Session Lockout
session_lockout_time=900 # 15 minutes (900 seconds)

# 5.1.6 Account Lockout
failon=5 # Lockout after 5 failed attempts
lock_time=900 #Lockout for 15 minutes
retry_time=0,1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024 # Time doubling throttling
max_tries=12 # Permanent lockout after 12 failed attempts (IT reset required).

# 5.1.7 Monitoring and Alerting
# Monitoring and alerting for login limits require external system integration.  This is just a guideline.

# 5.1.8 Account Suspension
inactive_days=45 # Suspend after 45 days of inactivity.

# 5.1.9 Password Hints
pwhint=0 # Disable password hints.

#MFA-specific minimum length handling would need a separate mechanism.  This is outside the scope of pwquality.conf.  For example, a PAM module or similar.
