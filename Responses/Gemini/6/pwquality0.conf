# Configuration file for the pwquality password quality module.
#
# This file uses the following syntax:
#   keyword = value

# Use MFA wherever possible (see 2.1).  This is not directly configurable in pwquality. Requires separate MFA implementation.

# Minimum password length (see 5.1.1).  This needs a conditional setting based on MFA status, which is not directly supported by pwquality
minlen = 8 # Default for MFA accounts;  Policy should handle enforcement of 14 for password-only accounts separately outside pwquality

# Maximum password length (see 5.1.1).  No limit
maxlen = 999999  # Effectively unlimited

# Password complexity rules (see 5.1.2).  At least one non-alphabetic character for non-MFA accounts; Policy should handle other char types enforcement separately outside pwquality
dcredit = -1  # No specific digit requirement.  MFA accounts may allow passwords to consist of all alpha characters
ucredit = -1 # No specific uppercase requirement.  MFA accounts may allow passwords to consist of all lowercase characters
lcredit = -1 # No specific lowercase requirement.  MFA accounts may allow passwords to consist of all uppercase characters
ocredit = 1 # At least one non-alphabetic character required for non-MFA accounts.

# Password aging (see 5.1.3).  Immediate change on breach; annual expiration as backstop. This is not directly configurable in pwquality. Requires separate breach detection and password management system.
# reage =  # pwquality doesn't directly support immediate password changes upon breach. Requires separate mechanism.
# maxage = 31536000 # One year in seconds (annual expiration)

# Password history and retry handling (see 5.1.4, 5.1.6)
remember = 5  # Remember the last 5 passwords
minclass = 1 # requires at least one type of character (alpha, digit, special)
# enforce_for_root = true  # Consider enforcing a separate, stricter policy for the root account.
try_count = 5  # Number of failed attempts before temporary lockout
retry_delay = 15  #Minutes of temporary lockout
#pw_delay = 86400 #Password change delay of 1 day in seconds

# Session timeout (see 5.1.5)
# This needs to be enforced separately outside pwquality
#session_timeout = 900 # 15 minutes in seconds

# Account lockout (see 5.1.6)
#pw_lock_time = 900 # 15 minutes temporary lockout,  The delay mechanism needs to be handled by a separate system or script.
# throttling_delay = [0,1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024] # Time doubling throttling (This requires external scripting)
# max_lockouts = 12 # Permanent account lockout after 12 retries (this requires an external mechanism to handle the permanent lockout)


# Alerting (see 5.1.7) This requires separate alerting mechanism.  pwquality does not handle alerts.


# Account suspension (see 5.1.8) This needs to be enforced separately outside pwquality.
# inactive_days = 45

# Password hints (see 5.1.9)
# This configuration is not present in pwquality. This should be handled by a separate mechanism during the login process that prevents hints from being given.


# denylist_file = "/etc/security/pwquality.deny" # Path to a deny list file (see 5.1.4) - Requires populating a list of common passwords and previous passwords.
