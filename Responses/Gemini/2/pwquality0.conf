# Configuration file for the pam_pwquality module.
#
# The pam_pwquality module is used to check the strength of newly chosen
# passwords. The checks are configurable via the following parameters.
#
# See the pam_pwquality man page for a detailed description of all parameters.

# Password must be at least 8 characters long.
minlen = 8

# Require at least one lowercase character. (Satisfies "at least 1 alpha")
lcredit = -1

# Require at least one digit. (Satisfies "at least 1 numeric character")
dcredit = -1

# Check if the new password contains the user's username in any form.
# (Satisfies "not be part of your name or user name")
username = 1

# Check if the new password contains strings from the user's GECOS field.
# (Satisfies "not be part of your name or user name")
gecoscheck = 1

# Note: The rules "must be changed at least every 90 days", "not be inserted
# into email...", "not be written down...", and "only change your password
# once every two days" are generally enforced by other system configurations
# (e.g., /etc/login.defs for age/frequency) or are organizational policies
# and user behavior, and thus cannot be directly configured within
# pwquality.conf.
#
# Dictionary word checks are typically handled implicitly by the underlying
# cracklib library that pam_pwquality uses, provided dictionary files are
# installed on the system.
