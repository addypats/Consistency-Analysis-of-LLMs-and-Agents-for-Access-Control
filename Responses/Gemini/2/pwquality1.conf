```
# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file configures the PAM pwquality module.
# It is used to set the password quality requirements for new passwords.

# All passwords must be at least 8 characters long.
minlen = 8

# Passwords must contain at least 1 alpha character.
# By requiring both a lowercase and an uppercase character, we ensure
# the presence of alpha characters from multiple cases.
lcredit = -1
ucredit = -1

# Passwords must contain at least 1 numeric character.
dcredit = -1

# Passwords should not be based on a dictionary word.
dictcheck = 1

# Passwords should not be part of your name or username.
gecoscheck = 1
usercheck = 1

# Other policy rules such as password expiration (e.g., every 90 days),
# not sharing passwords, or not writing them down, are typically
# enforced by other system configurations (like /etc/login.defs for expiration)
# and organizational security policies, not directly by pwquality.conf.
