# Dictionary file path
# This is commented out as a dictionary file is not part of the standard distribution.
# Providing a dictionary file is a security risk and should only be done with caution.  
# You must use a system-specific dictionary file that is appropriate for your locale. 
#dict=/usr/share/dict/words

# These settings enforce password complexity based on different character classes.
# Setting values higher than 0 will enforce these rules.
#  You should enable the other rules instead of relying on these.
#minclass=3

# Password aging settings
# This setting is intentionally left out because while it is related to password lifespan, it does not directly enforce the 90 day requirement.
# Instead, administrative controls should be used (e.g., account lockouts or external scripts) to enforce this aspect of the policy outside of pwquality.
