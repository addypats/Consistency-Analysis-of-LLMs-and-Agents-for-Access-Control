```ini
# pwquality.conf configuration file for the pam_pwquality module.
#
# This file sets the password quality requirements for new passwords.
# Rules from the request are mapped to the corresponding parameters below.

# --- Password Quality Rules (from request) ---

# All passwords must be at least 8 characters long
minlen = 8

# Must contain at least 1 alpha character
minalpha = 1

# Must contain at least 1 numeric character
mindigit = 1

# Dictionary word check:
# The pwquality.conf file itself does not directly integrate a full
# dictionary check like cracklib. The 'badwords' parameter can be used
# to specify a comma-separated list of common words to explicitly avoid.
# For comprehensive dictionary checks, pam_pwquality often relies on
# underlying libraries like cracklib which are typically configured via
# the PAM configuration (e.g., /etc/pam.d/system-auth).
# You can uncomment and add specific bad words here if needed:
# badwords =

# Must not be part of your name or user name
usercheck = 1

# --- Password Change Frequency Rule (from request) ---

# Minimum time in seconds between password changes.
# (You can only change your password once every two days = 2 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes * 60 seconds = 172800 seconds)
minwait = 172800

# --- Behavioral Rules (from request - not configurable in pwquality.conf) ---
# The following rules are behavioral or are handled by other system components:
#
# - "All passwords must be changed at least every 90 days."
#   This is typically enforced by the pam_unix.so module using the 'maxdays'
#   option in PAM configuration (e.g., /etc/pam.d/system-auth) or by the
#   'chage' command. It is not directly configured in pwquality.conf.
#
# - "Passwords must not be inserted into email messages or other forms of
#    electronic communication and should not be shared with anyone, including
#    via email or phone conversations."
# - "Passwords should not be written down or stored electronically without encryption."
#   These are organizational and security best practice policies, not
#   technical configurations within pwquality.conf.
