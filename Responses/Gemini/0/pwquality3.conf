```conf
# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file configures the password quality checking library libpwquality.
# Rules are processed from top to bottom.

# Rule: Passwords must adhere to a minimum length of 10 characters.
minlen = 10

# Rule: Passwords must contain a combination of alpha, numeric, and special characters.
# Set to -1 to require at least one character of the specific type.
lcredit = -1    # Require at least one lowercase character
ucredit = -1    # Require at least one uppercase character
dcredit = -1    # Require at least one digit
ocredit = -1    # Require at least one 'other' (special) character

# Rule: Passwords must not be dictionary words or acronyms.
dictcheck = 1

# Helps prevent simple patterns and acronyms like 'aaabbb' or '111aaa'.
maxrepeat = 3       # Maximum number of allowed consecutive identical characters (e.g., 'aaa')
maxclassrepeat = 3  # Maximum number of allowed consecutive characters from the same class (e.g., '111')

# --- Rules NOT directly handled by /etc/security/pwquality.conf ---

# Rule: Passwords must be changed every 90 days.
# This policy is typically enforced by user account expiration settings,
# configured in /etc/login.defs (e.g., PASS_MAX_DAYS) or managed via the 'chage' command.
# It is NOT a parameter within libpwquality or pwquality.conf.

# Rule: Passwords cannot be reused for 1 year.
# This policy is enforced by PAM password history modules, such as pam_unix.so
# or pam_pwhistory.so, which are configured in files like /etc/pam.d/system-auth
# or /etc/pam.d/password-auth using the 'remember' option (e.g., 'remember=365').
# It is NOT a parameter within libpwquality or pwquality.conf.

# Rule: Passwords must not be easily tied back to the account owner such as:
# Username, social security number, nickname, relative’s names, birth date, etc.
# While the libpwquality library does perform some implicit checks to prevent
# passwords that are trivial variations of the username or GECOS field,
# specific rejections based on username or GECOS are typically configured as
# options for the pam_pwquality.so module within PAM configuration files
# (e.g., /etc/pam.d/system-auth, with options like 'reject_username' and 'reject_gecos').
# There are no direct parameters in pwquality.conf to *explicitly* configure these rejections.
# Preventing other personal data (SSN, names, birth dates) would generally require
# custom `badwords` lists (not practical for a generic policy) or more advanced PAM modules.
