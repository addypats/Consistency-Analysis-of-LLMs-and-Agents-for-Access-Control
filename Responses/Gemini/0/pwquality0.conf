# Password aging
# Setting this to 0 will disable password aging
# Changing the password every 90 days
# 90 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute = 7776000 seconds
# This setting should be considered carefully, and is set to 0 by default.
# Uncommenting the following line and setting a positive integer value
# will enable password aging
# For 90 days
# try to avoid using this aging setting 
# as it may disrupt automated password rotation and
# renewal systems.
# remember that this value is calculated in seconds.

# Note:  The dictionary check and the account-specific prohibitions
# (Username, social security number, nickname, relative’s names, birth date, etc.)
# cannot be enforced by this configuration file.  Additional measures are required to enforce them,
# such as using a PAM module or external tool that checks against a dictionary
# and a list of prohibited words/patterns related to the user accounts.
