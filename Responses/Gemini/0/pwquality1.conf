# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file defines password quality rules for the pam_pwquality module.

# Rule: Passwords must adhere to a minimum length of 10 characters.
minlen = 10

# Rule: Passwords must contain a combination of alpha, numeric, and special characters.
# 'minclass = 4' requires at least one character from each of four classes:
# lowercase, uppercase, digits, and other (special characters like !@#$%^&*).
minclass = 4

# Rule: Passwords must not be dictionary words or acronyms.
dictcheck = 1

# Rule: Passwords must not be easily tied back to the account owner
# (e.g., Username, social security number, nickname, relative’s names, birth date, etc.).
# 'gecoscheck = 1' prevents the use of parts of the username and GECOS fields.
gecoscheck = 1
# These settings further prevent simple patterns and contribute to this rule:
maxrepeat = 3   # No more than 3 consecutive identical characters (e.g., "aaa").
maxsequence = 3 # No more than 3 characters in a monotonic sequence (e.g., "abc", "123").
# Custom forbidden words can be added using 'badwords = word1,word2,...'.

# --- The following rules are NOT configured directly in pwquality.conf ---

# Rule: Passwords must be changed every 90 days.
# This is typically configured system-wide in /etc/login.defs (MAX_DAYS)
# or for individual users with 'chage -M 90 <username>'.

# Rule: Passwords cannot be reused for 1 year.
# This is typically configured in PAM files (e.g., /etc/pam.d/system-auth or /etc/pam.d/password-auth)
# by adding 'remember=X' to the 'password requisite pam_pwhistory.so' line.
# For example, if passwords are changed every 90 days, 'remember=4' would cover approximately one year.
