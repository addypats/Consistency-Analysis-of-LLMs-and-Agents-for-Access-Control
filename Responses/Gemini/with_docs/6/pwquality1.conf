# 5.1.1 - Require a minimum length of 14 characters for password-only accounts.
# NIST 5.1.1 also specifies 8 characters for MFA-enabled accounts.
# As pwquality.conf applies globally, we apply the stricter requirement (14) as the default.
# Differentiating between account types (e.g., MFA-enabled vs. password-only) would
# typically be handled by PAM configuration (e.g., loading different pam_pwquality.so
# configurations for specific user groups or authentication contexts).
minlen = 14

# 5.1.1 - Do not limit the maximum length of passwords.
# A value of 0 for maxlen means no maximum length is enforced, allowing passwords
# to be as long as system constraints permit.
maxlen = 0

# 5.1.2 - Allow all character types in a password and require at least one
# non-alphabetic character for password-only accounts.
# ocredit: Minimum number of other characters (non-alphanumeric/special characters).
# NIST 5.1.2 emphasizes entropy; no specific requirements for digits, uppercase,
# or lowercase are mandated beyond allowing a large character set.
ocredit = 1

# 5.1.4 - Check on new password creation against an internal deny list of known bad, weak,
# or previous 5 passwords.
# remember: Number of previous passwords to remember and disallow reuse.
remember = 5
# badwords: Path to a file containing a list of forbidden words (e.g., common passwords).
# This file must be created and maintained by the system administrator.
badwords = /etc/security/pwquality_badwords.txt


# The following NIST SP 800-63B requirements are not configurable directly
# within /etc/security/pwquality.conf, but are noted for completeness:
#
# 2.1 - Use MFA wherever possible: This is an authentication mechanism handled by PAM and other system components, not password quality rules.
# 5.1.3 - Change password immediately in the event of a breach: This is an administrative policy and action.
# 5.1.3 - Annual expiration as a backstop: Handled by /etc/login.defs (PASS_MAX_DAYS) or 'chage'.
# 5.1.4 - Enforce a password change delay of at least one day: Handled by /etc/login.defs (PASS_MIN_DAYS) or PAM.
# 5.1.5 - Lock current session after 15 minutes of inactivity: Handled by desktop environment settings, TMOUT variable, or session managers.
# 5.1.6 - Temporary account lockout (15 mins+) after 5 failed attempts: Handled by PAM modules like pam_faillock.so or pam_tally2.so.
# 5.1.6 - Time doubling throttling (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, etc.) with permanent lockout after 12 retries: Handled by PAM modules like pam_faillock.so.
# 5.1.7 - Monitor and alert key personnel for bad login attempts: Handled by system logging, auditing (auditd), and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.
# 5.1.8 - Automatically suspend account after 45 days without valid login: Handled by /etc/login.defs (INACTIVE) or custom account management scripts.
# 5.1.9 - Do not allow user-defined password "hints": Handled by identity management systems or specific login applications, not by password quality rules.
