# Minimum password length in characters.
minlen = 14

# Maximum password length. Set to -1 for no limit.
maxlen = -1

# Minimum number of character classes required in the password.
# Classes are: lowercase, uppercase, digits, and other (special characters).
# Setting this to 2 ensures at least one non-alphabetic character if
# an alphabetic character is also present (e.g., lowercase + digit, or uppercase + symbol).
minclass = 2

# Path to a file containing a list of forbidden passwords (dictionary).
# Each password in the file should be on a separate line.
badwords = /etc/security/pwquality.badwords

# Number of characters in the new password that must not be present in the old
# password at the same position. This helps prevent minor changes to old passwords.
# Note: This does not check against a history of entire old passwords;
# that functionality is typically provided by PAM modules like pam_pwhistory.
difok = 5

# The following password policy rules cannot be directly configured within
# /etc/security/pwquality.conf, as they relate to account management,
# session management, or PAM authentication stack configuration:
#
# - Use MFA wherever possible (2.1)
# - Annual expiration as a backstop (5.1.3)
# - Check against previous 5 passwords (full password history) (5.1.4)
# - Password change delay of at least one day (5.1.4)
# - Lock current session after 15 minutes of inactivity (5.1.5)
# - Temporary account lockout after five failed attempts (5.1.6)
# - Time doubling throttling between retries (5.1.6)
# - Permanent account lockout after 12 retries (5.1.6)
# - Monitor and alert key personnel on bad login attempts (5.1.7)
# - Automatically suspend account after 45 days without login (5.1.8)
# - Do not allow user-defined password "hints" (5.1.9)
#
# These rules would typically be configured via PAM modules (e.g., pam_faillock.so,
# pam_pwhistory.so, pam_unix.so), system-wide login settings (e.g., /etc/login.defs,
# chage command), or desktop environment/application settings.
