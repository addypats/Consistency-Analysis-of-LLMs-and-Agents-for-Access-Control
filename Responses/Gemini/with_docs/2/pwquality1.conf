```conf
# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file configures the password quality requirements for new passwords.
# Policies are based on the provided rules.

# All passwords must be at least 8 characters long.
minlen = 8

# Must contain at least 1 alpha and 1 numeric character.
# 'lcredit = -1' requires at least one lowercase letter.
# 'dcredit = -1' requires at least one digit.
# This combination fulfills "at least 1 alpha" (via lowercase) and "1 numeric".
# For a more stringent alpha requirement (e.g., lowercase AND uppercase),
# 'ucredit = -1' would also be needed.
lcredit = -1
dcredit = -1

# Passwords should not be based on a dictionary word.
# This typically relies on a dictionary file configured via 'dictpath',
# e.g., dictpath = /usr/share/cracklib/pw_dict
dictcheck = 1

# Passwords should not be part of your name (GECOS fields) or user name.
gecoscheck = 1
usernamecheck = 1

# Enforce that at least 5 characters must differ from the old password.
# This helps prevent trivial password changes.
# Note: The rule "You can only change your password once every two days" is
# typically managed by 'PASS_MIN_DAYS' in /etc/login.defs or by PAM modules,
# not directly by pwquality.conf.
difok = 5

# --- General policy notes (not directly configurable in pwquality.conf) ---
#
# - Password expiration (e.g., every 90 days) is usually set via 'PASS_MAX_DAYS'
#   in /etc/login.defs and enforced by tools like 'chage' or PAM modules.
# - Rules regarding not sharing passwords, not inserting them into electronic
#   communication, or not writing them down without encryption are organizational
#   policies and user behavior guidelines, not technical configurations for pwquality.conf.
# - NIST SP 800-63B guidelines are a reference; specific rules implemented here
#   are as per the user's explicit request.
