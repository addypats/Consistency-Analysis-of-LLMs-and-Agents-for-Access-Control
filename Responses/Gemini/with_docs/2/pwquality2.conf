# This file configures the password quality requirements for new passwords.
# Parameters not explicitly set will use their default values.

# All passwords must be at least 8 characters long.
minlen = 8

# All passwords must contain at least 1 lowercase alphabetic character.
lcredit = -1

# All passwords must contain at least 1 numeric character.
dcredit = -1

# All passwords should not be part of your name or user name.
# This checks against the user's login name and parts of their GECOS field.
reject_user_and_gecos = 1

# Note:
# - Password aging (e.g., change every 90 days) and minimum change time (e.g., once every two days)
#   are typically configured in /etc/login.defs (PASS_MAX_DAYS, PASS_MIN_DAYS) or via 'chage'.
# - Checking against dictionary words is generally handled by the underlying libpwquality/cracklib
#   library by default, without requiring a specific pwquality.conf parameter to enable it.
# - Rules regarding not sharing, writing down, or inserting into email are behavioral policies
#   and not configurable within this file.
