# This file configures the pam_pwquality module.
#
# Some password policy rules mentioned in the request cannot be directly
# enforced by /etc/security/pwquality.conf. This file focuses on the
# quality (complexity) of new passwords.
#
# Rules not directly handled by this file:
# - "All passwords must be changed at least every 90 days."
#   This is typically managed by password aging settings (e.g., in /etc/login.defs
#   or using the 'chage' command for individual users).
# - "Passwords must not be inserted into email messages or other forms of
#   electronic communication and should not be shared with anyone,
#   including via email or phone conversations."
#   This is an organizational policy, not a technical enforcement by pwquality.conf.
# - "Passwords should not be written down or stored electronically without encryption."
#   This is an organizational policy, not a technical enforcement by pwquality.conf.
# - "You can only change your password once every two days."
#   This is usually managed by the PASS_MIN_DAYS setting in /etc/login.defs
#   or via pam_unix.so parameters like 'minlen=N'.

# Minimum number of characters in the password.
# Rule: "All passwords must be at least 8 characters long"
minlen = 8

# Require at least one lowercase character.
# Part of "contain at least 1 alpha and 1 numeric character"
lcredit = -1

# Require at least one uppercase character.
# Part of "contain at least 1 alpha and 1 numeric character"
ucredit = -1

# Require at least one digit (numeric character).
# Part of "contain at least 1 alpha and 1 numeric character"
dcredit = -1

# Check the new password against a dictionary.
# Rule: "should not be based on a dictionary word"
dictcheck = 1

# Check if the password contains the user's name (username).
# Rule: "not be part of your name or user name"
usercheck = 1

# Check if the password contains words from the GECOS field (full name).
# Rule: "not be part of your name or user name"
gecoscheck = 1

# Other optional parameters (uncomment and adjust as needed):
# minclass = N     # Minimum number of character classes (lower, upper, digit, other)
# ocredit = -1     # Require at least one 'other' (special) character
# maxrepeat = 0    # Maximum number of allowed consecutive identical characters
# maxclassrepeat = 0 # Maximum number of allowed consecutive characters of the same class
# difok = 5        # Minimum number of characters that must be different from the old password
# enforce_for_root = 1 # Apply policies to root as well (default is 0)
