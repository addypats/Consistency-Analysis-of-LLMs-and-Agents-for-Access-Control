# Idle timeout for re-authentication
# This setting doesn't directly map to pwquality.conf, and requires separate session management configuration
#  The following comment is for clarity and is NOT a pwquality setting.
# idle_timeout = 900 # 15 minutes in seconds


# MFA is not directly configurable in pwquality.conf.  This requires separate system-level configuration (e.g., PAM, LDAP)
#  This comment is for clarity and is NOT a pwquality setting.
# MFA enforcement needs to be handled by other tools and configurations outside this file.

# Hardcoded passwords in scripts are not directly prevented by pwquality, but require coding best practices
#  This comment is for clarity and is NOT a pwquality setting.
# Secure coding practices should prevent this;  auditing and code reviews are needed for enforcement
