# The following settings are not directly configurable via pwquality.conf but are included for completeness based on the provided requirements.  They would need to be implemented through other system mechanisms.

#  Always change vendor-supplied defaults (passwords and settings) and remove or disable unnecessary default accounts before installing a system on the network (see 2.1).  (Manual process)
# Remove/disable inactive user accounts within 90 days (see 8.1.4). (Requires separate user management script)
# Set passwords for first-time use and upon reset to a unique value for each user, and change immediately after the first use (see 8.2.6). (Requires separate user management script)
# Authenticate user access to assets with at least one of the following methods: password or a passphrase, any biometric method, Smart Card, or an authentication token. These authentication mechanisms must be encrypted during transmission and storage. (see 8.3.1.) (Requires separate authentication system)
# Implement and enforce MFA across all access into the CDE and for all remote access and document all MFA access (8.4.1 to 8.5.1) (Requires separate MFA system)
# Passwords must not be hardcoded on scripts and must be periodically changed (8.6.2,8.6.3) (Requires coding standards and security review)
# Change passwords/passphrases if there is any suspicion or knowledge that the password/passphrases have been compromised. (See 8.3.8) (Requires incident response plan)
