#The following settings address requirements that are not directly configurable via pwquality.conf, but are good security practices.  They should be implemented through other mechanisms (e.g., PAM configuration, other authentication systems, and organizational policies).


#Note: MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) and encryption during transmission and storage are not directly configurable through pwquality.conf. They require separate system-wide security measures and configurations. Similarly, preventing hardcoded passwords in scripts necessitates careful coding practices and appropriate access controls, rather than relying on pwquality.
