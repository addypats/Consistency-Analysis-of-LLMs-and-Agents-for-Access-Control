# Configuration for the pam_pwquality module
#
# The pam_pwquality module checks the strength of passwords.
# This file is read by the pam_pwquality module and specifies
# the password policy rules.
#
# For more information, see the pwquality.conf(5) man page.

# Minimum acceptable password length.
# (See 8.3.6 - Passwords/passphrases must have a minimum length of 12 characters)
minlen = 12

# Require at least one digit.
# (See 8.3.6 - must contain both numeric and alphabetic characters)
dcredit = -1

# Require at least one lowercase character.
# (See 8.3.6 - must contain both numeric and alphabetic characters)
lcredit = -1

# Require at least one uppercase character.
# (See 8.3.6 - must contain both numeric and alphabetic characters)
ucredit = -1

# Do not require any other special characters.
# ocredit = 0

# (Other policies like password history, account lockout, expiration,
#  and MFA are handled by other PAM modules, system configurations like
#  /etc/login.defs, or operational procedures, not pwquality.conf.)
