# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
# Password policy based on NIST SP 800-63B recommendations.

# Passwords must be at least 15 characters in length.
# NIST encourages length over complexity, so this enforces the stronger recommendation
# ("should be at least 15 characters").
minlen = 15

# Composition rules for including special characters are no longer required,
# as these often lead to predictable passwords.
# Long passwords are encouraged over complex ones, allowing for passphrases.
dcredit = 0   # No requirement for digits
ucredit = 0   # No requirement for uppercase letters
lcredit = 0   # No requirement for lowercase letters
ocredit = 0   # No requirement for other (special) characters

# Authenticators should monitor newly registered passwords for obvious security weaknesses,
# like sequential number strings and common words.
# The underlying cracklib library screens for many common weak patterns and dictionary words.
# The 'badwords' parameter can be used to add a custom list of forbidden words if needed.
# For example: badwords = /etc/security/pwquality-badwords.txt
# Leaving it commented relies on cracklib's internal dictionaries.
#badwords =

# Screen new passwords against parts of the user's GECOS field (personal information).
# This helps prevent users from setting passwords related to their name or other public info.
gecoscheck = 1

# Prevent excessive repetition of the same character.
# Setting this to '3' means a character can repeat up to 3 times consecutively,
# but not 4 or more (e.g., 'aaa' is okay, 'aaaa' is not).
maxrepeat = 3

# Prevent excessive repetition of characters from the same character class.
# Setting to '3' means a maximum of 3 consecutive characters from the same class.
maxclassrepeat = 3

# Note on "Authenticators should screen new passwords against lists of previously
# compromised passwords": This typically requires integration with external services
# or PAM modules (e.g., pam_pwned) and is not a direct parameter in pwquality.conf.
# However, cracklib's dictionaries implicitly cover many commonly breached passwords.
