# NIST SP 800-63-4, Section 5.1.1.1 Memorized Secrets
# https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html

# "Memorized secrets SHALL be at least 8 characters in length if chosen by the subscriber."
# "Verifiers SHALL require subscriber-chosen memorized secrets to be at least 8 characters in length."
minlen = 8

# "No other complexity requirements for memorized secrets SHOULD be imposed."
# "Verifiers SHOULD NOT impose other composition rules (e.g., requiring mixtures of different character types or prohibiting consecutively repeated characters) for memorized secrets."
# This means we avoid requirements for specific character classes.
minclass = 0
lcredit = 0
ucredit = 0
dcredit = 0
ocredit = 0

# "When processing requests to establish and change memorized secrets, verifiers SHALL compare the prospective secrets against a list that contains values known to be commonly-used, expected, or compromised."
# This includes:
# - Dictionary words
# - Repetitive or sequential characters (e.g. aaaaaa, 1234abcd)
# - Context-specific words, such as the name of the service, the username, and derivatives thereof.
# - Passwords obtained from previous breach corpuses

# Check against common dictionary words.
dictcheck = 1

# Limit consecutive identical characters. (e.g., rejects 'aaaa' if set to 3)
# This helps catch "repetitive characters" mentioned in NIST guidelines for blacklisting.
maxrepeat = 3

# Limit consecutive characters in a sequence. (e.g., rejects 'abcd' if set to 3)
# This helps catch "sequential characters" mentioned in NIST guidelines for blacklisting.
maxsequence = 3

# Check for parts of the GECOS field (username, full name, etc.)
# This helps catch "context-specific words" mentioned in NIST guidelines for blacklisting.
gecoscheck = 1

# Provide a path to a custom list of "bad words" for additional blacklisting.
# This file should contain common/compromised values, service names, etc.,
# as per NIST guidelines ("Passwds obtained from previous breach corpuses", "Context-specific words").
# The administrator is responsible for creating and maintaining this file.
badwords = /etc/security/pwquality.d/badwords.txt

# The following settings are either implicitly handled or not explicitly
# mandated by NIST 800-63-4 for pwquality.conf:
# maxlen: No explicit upper limit, handled by PAM/application.
# enforce_for_root: Default (no) is acceptable.
# retry: Default (3) is acceptable for user feedback.
