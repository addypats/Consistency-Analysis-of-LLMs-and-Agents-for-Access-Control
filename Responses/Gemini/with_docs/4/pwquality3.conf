# "Memorized secrets SHALL be at least 8 characters in length if chosen by the subscriber."
# "Verifiers SHALL require subscriber-chosen memorized secrets to be at least 8 characters in length."
minlen = 8

# "No other complexity requirements for memorized secrets SHOULD be imposed."
# "Verifiers SHOULD NOT impose other composition rules (e.g., requiring mixtures of different character types or prohibiting consecutively repeated characters) for memorized secrets."
# This means no requirements for specific character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters).
lcredit = 0
ucredit = 0
dcredit = 0
ocredit = 0
minclass = 0

# "When processing requests to establish and change memorized secrets, verifiers SHALL compare the prospective secrets against a list that contains values known to be commonly-used, expected, or compromised."

# "Passwords obtained from previous breach corpuses, Dictionary words"
# This setting points to a file that must contain a list of known compromised passwords and common dictionary words.
# The administrator is responsible for creating and maintaining this file.
badwords = /etc/security/pwquality.badwords

# "Context-specific words, such as ... the username, and derivatives thereof."
# Disallow the username (or variations of it) from being part of the password.
username = 1
# Disallow words from the GECOS field (e.g., full name, office number) from being part of the password.
gecoscheck = 1
# Disallow passwords that are simple dictionary words.
dictcheck = 1

# "Repetitive or sequential characters (e.g. aaaaaa, 1234abcd)"
# These settings act as a blacklist check against easily guessable patterns like long sequences of identical or sequential characters,
# rather than enforcing character type composition.
# Limits the maximum number of allowed consecutive same characters (e.g., 'aaa' is okay, 'aaaa' is not if set to 3).
maxrepeat = 3
# Limits the maximum number of allowed consecutive characters that are digits or alphabet characters in sequence (e.g., 'abc' is okay, 'abcd' is not if set to 3).
maxsequence = 3

# "If the CSP or verifier disallows a chosen memorized secret based on its appearance on a blacklist of compromised values, the subscriber SHALL be required to choose a different memorized secret."
# "Verifiers SHOULD NOT require memorized secrets to be changed arbitrarily (e.g., periodically)."
# NIST does not explicitly require a specific number of characters to differ from the old password, but rather a check against compromised values.
# Setting difok to 0 disables the check for differences from the old password, allowing the system to rely solely on the blacklist and complexity rules.
difok = 0

# Other considerations not directly configurable via pwquality.conf:
# - "Verifiers SHOULD permit subscriber-chosen memorized secrets at least 64 characters in length."
#   (pwquality.conf does not set maximum length; this is typically handled by PAM or applications.)
# - "All printing ASCII [...] characters as well as the space character SHOULD be acceptable in memorized secrets. Unicode [...] characters SHOULD be accepted as well."
#   (pwquality supports UTF-8 if compiled with it and the system locale is set correctly. No direct setting here.)
# - "Verifiers SHALL implement a rate-limiting mechanism..."
#   (This is handled by PAM modules like pam_faillock or pam_tally2.)
