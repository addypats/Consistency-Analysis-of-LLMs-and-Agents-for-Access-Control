# Password quality policy based on NIST SP 800-63B
# Reference: https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html

# "Memorized secrets SHALL be at least 8 characters in length if chosen by the subscriber."
minlen = 8

# "No other complexity requirements for memorized secrets SHOULD be imposed."
# This disables requirements for specific character types.
lcredit = 0  # No lowercase character requirement
ucredit = 0  # No uppercase character requirement
dcredit = 0  # No digit character requirement
ocredit = 0  # No special character requirement
minclass = 0 # No minimum number of character classes (e.g., lowercase, uppercase, digit, special)

# "Verifiers SHALL compare the prospective secrets against a list that contains values known to be commonly-used, expected, or compromised."
# This includes dictionary words, repetitive/sequential characters, context-specific words, and usernames.
# The `badwords` file needs to be created and populated by the administrator for custom blacklisting.
badwords = /etc/security/pwquality-badwords.txt
gecoscheck = 1     # Check against user's GECOS (full name, etc.)
dictcheck = 1      # Check against common dictionary words
reject_username = 1 # Reject passwords that are the username or simple transformations

# "Verifiers SHOULD NOT impose other composition rules..."
# This includes rules about how different a new password must be from the old one.
difok = 0 # No requirement for difference from old password
