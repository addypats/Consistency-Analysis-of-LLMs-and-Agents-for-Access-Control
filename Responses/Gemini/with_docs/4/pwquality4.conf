# The pam_pwquality module is an enterprise-class tool to help users

# Settings in this file implement the NIST SP 800-63B Digital Identity Guidelines
# for Memorized Secrets.

# Enforce a minimum length of 8 characters for subscriber-chosen memorized secrets.
# "Memorized secrets SHALL be at least 8 characters in length if chosen by the subscriber."
minlen = 8

# No other complexity requirements SHOULD be imposed by NIST SP 800-63B.
# Therefore, we set all credit options to 0 (no requirement for character classes).
# "No other complexity requirements for memorized secrets SHOULD be imposed."
lcredit = 0   # No requirement for lowercase characters
ucredit = 0   # No requirement for uppercase characters
dcredit = 0   # No requirement for digit characters
ocredit = 0   # No requirement for other/special characters

# Allow any number of consecutive repeating characters or character classes.
# NIST 800-63B does not impose restrictions on repeating characters.
# "Verifiers SHOULD NOT impose other composition rules (e.g., requiring mixtures of
# different character types or prohibiting consecutively repeated characters) for memorized secrets."
maxrepeat = -1      # Allow any number of consecutive identical characters
maxclassrepeat = -1 # Allow any number of consecutive characters from the same class

# Implement blacklisting against commonly-used, expected, or compromised values.
# "When processing requests to establish and change memorized secrets, verifiers SHALL compare
# the prospective secrets against a list that contains values known to be commonly-used, expected, or compromised."
# The badwords file must be created and maintained by the administrator with values
# like those obtained from previous breach corpuses, dictionary words, etc.
badwords = /etc/security/pwquality-bad-passwords.txt

# Check if the new password contains parts of the user's GECOS field (full name, etc.).
# This helps prevent context-specific words like username, full name, or derivatives.
# "Context-specific words, such as the name of the service, the username, and derivatives thereof."
gecoscheck = 1

# Other NIST guidelines (e.g., rate-limiting, no hints, no arbitrary periodic changes,
# Unicode support, normalization) are handled by other system components
# (e.g., PAM faillock, system design, underlying crypto libraries)
# and are not directly configurable in pwquality.conf.
