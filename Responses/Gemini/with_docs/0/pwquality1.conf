# /etc/security/pwquality.conf

# This file configures the libpwquality library to enforce password
# quality rules based on the provided requirements.

# Minimum password length.
# Requirement: Passwords must adhere to a minimum length of 10 characters.
minlen = 10

# Require at least one digit. (-1 for required)
# Requirement: Passwords must contain a combination of alpha, numeric, and special characters.
dcredit = -1

# Require at least one uppercase letter.
# Requirement: Passwords must contain a combination of alpha, numeric, and special characters.
ucredit = -1

# Require at least one lowercase letter.
# Requirement: Passwords must contain a combination of alpha, numeric, and special characters.
lcredit = -1

# Require at least one other (special) character.
# Requirement: Passwords must contain a combination of alpha, numeric, and special characters.
ocredit = -1

# Check if the new password contains parts of the GECOS field (full name, office, etc.).
# This helps prevent passwords easily tied back to the account owner's personal information.
# Requirement: Passwords must not be easily tied back to the account owner such as:
#              Username, social security number, nickname, relative’s names, birth date, etc.
# Note: pwquality implicitly checks against username substrings by default.
gecoscheck = 1

# Enable dictionary checking to prevent common dictionary words or acronyms.
# Requires a dictionary file (e.g., /usr/share/dict/cracklib-small) to be present and configured.
# Requirement: Passwords must not be dictionary words or acronyms.
dictcheck = 1

# The minimum number of characters that must be different from the old password.
# A higher value helps prevent simple modifications and reuse of previous patterns,
# implicitly making it harder to link to old passwords or simple username variations.
# Requirement: Passwords must not be easily tied back to the account owner.
difok = 7

# Note: Password expiration (e.g., "Passwords must be changed every 90 days") and
# password reuse history (e.g., "Passwords cannot be reused for 1 year") are
# handled by other PAM modules (e.g., pam_unix with 'remember' option, or pam_pwhistory)
# and system-wide settings like /etc/login.defs, not directly by pwquality.conf.
