#
# This file configures the pam_pwquality module, which checks the strength
# of new passwords. The rules below are derived from the provided password
# policy guidelines.

# "Memorized secrets SHALL be at least 8 characters in length if chosen by the subscriber."
# Also: "Verifiers SHALL require subscriber-chosen memorized secrets to be at least 8 characters in length."
minlen = 8

# "No other complexity requirements for memorized secrets SHOULD be imposed."
# "Verifiers SHOULD NOT impose other composition rules (e.g., requiring mixtures of different character types or prohibiting consecutively repeated characters) for memorized secrets."
# This means we should not require specific character classes (lowercase, uppercase, digits, others).
lcredit = 0
ucredit = 0
dcredit = 0
ocredit = 0
minclass = 0 # No minimum number of character classes required

# "Verifiers SHOULD permit subscriber-chosen memorized secrets at least 64 characters in length."
# The default maximum length is usually very high (e.g., 256 or 512) or unlimited,
# which satisfies this requirement. We will not explicitly set maxlen unless needed
# to limit it, which is not the case here.

# "When processing requests to establish and change memorized secrets, verifiers SHALL compare the prospective secrets against a list that contains values known to be commonly-used, expected, or compromised."
# "For example, the list MAY include, but is not limited to: Passwords obtained from previous breach corpuses, Dictionary words, Repetitive or sequential characters (e.g. aaaaaa, 1234abcd), Context-specific words, such as the name of the service, the username, and derivatives thereof."

# Enable dictionary checks against common words.
dictcheck = 1

# Provide a path to a custom file containing 'bad words' or known compromised passwords.
# This file needs to be created and populated by the administrator.
# Example: "Passwords obtained from previous breach corpuses"
# Uncomment and specify a file if you have one:
# badwords = /etc/security/pwquality-badwords.txt

# Max length of monotonic character sequences. Helps catch patterns like "1234", "abcd".
# Example "1234abcd" implies sequences of 4 or more are bad. Setting to 3 will reject 4+ character sequences.
maxseq = 3

# Max number of allowed consecutive same characters. Helps catch patterns like "aaaaaa".
# Example "aaaaaa" implies sequences of 4 or more identical chars are bad. Setting to 3 will reject 4+ identical characters.
maxrepeat = 3

# Max number of allowed consecutive characters belonging to the same character class.
# This works similarly to maxrepeat but for character classes.
maxclassrepeat = 3

# Check if the new password contains parts of the user's GECOS field.
# This addresses "Context-specific words, such as the name of the service" and derivatives.
gecoscheck = 1

# Check if the new password contains parts of the user's username.
# This addresses "Context-specific words, such as the name of the service, the username, and derivatives thereof."
usercheck = 1

# The policy implies that `pwquality` checks should apply to all users.
# It is good practice to enforce this for root as well.
enforce_for_root = 1

# "Verifiers SHOULD NOT require memorized secrets to be changed arbitrarily (e.g., periodically)."
# This is usually managed by `chage` or `pam_unix` and is not a pwquality.conf setting.

# "Verifiers SHALL NOT permit the subscriber to store a 'hint' that is accessible to an unauthenticated claimant."
# "Verifiers SHALL NOT prompt subscribers to use specific types of information..."
# "If Unicode characters are accepted in memorized secrets, the verifier SHOULD apply the Normalization Process..."
# "To make allowances for likely mistyping, verifiers MAY replace multiple consecutive space characters..."
# "Verifiers SHALL implement a rate-limiting mechanism..."
# These rules are related to application logic, verification processes, or other PAM modules (e.g., pam_faillock),
# and are not configured directly within /etc/security/pwquality.conf.

# "All printing ASCII characters as well as the space character SHOULD be acceptable in memorized secrets.
# Unicode characters SHOULD be accepted as well."
# pam_pwquality generally allows any characters supported by the system's locale and the underlying
# password hashing mechanism, as long as they don't violate the other configured rules.
# No specific pwquality.conf setting is needed to enable this, rather the absence of character restrictions.

# "difok" (number of characters that must be different from the old password)
# The policy states "SHOULD NOT impose other composition rules". While difok aids security,
# it is a composition rule. To strictly adhere to "No other complexity requirements SHOULD be imposed",
# we set it to 0, allowing any change regardless of character difference.
difok = 0
