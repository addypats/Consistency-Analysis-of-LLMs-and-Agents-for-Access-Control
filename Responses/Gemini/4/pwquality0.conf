# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file configures the PAM pwquality module.
# Based on NIST SP 800-63B guidelines for Memorized Secrets.

# 1. Memorized secrets SHALL be at least 8 characters in length.
#    Verifiers SHALL require subscriber-chosen memorized secrets to be at least 8 characters in length.
minlen = 8

# 2. No other complexity requirements for memorized secrets SHOULD be imposed.
#    Verifiers SHOULD NOT impose other composition rules (e.g., requiring mixtures of different character types).
#    This means we disable requirements for uppercase, lowercase, digits, and other characters.
minclass = 0
minupper = 0
minlower = 0
mindigit = 0
minother = 0

# 3. Verifiers SHOULD permit subscriber-chosen memorized secrets at least 64 characters in length.
#    Setting a practical high maximum length.
maxlen = 256

# 4. Verifiers SHALL compare the prospective secrets against a list that contains values known to be commonly-used, expected, or compromised.
#    This includes:
#    - Dictionary words
#    - Context-specific words, such as the name of the service, the username, and derivatives thereof.
#    - Repetitive or sequential characters (e.g. aaaaaa, 1234abcd)
dictcheck = 1
gecoscheck = 1

# badwords: List of words that cannot be contained in the password.
# To implement "Passwords obtained from previous breach corpuses" and other specific bad values,
# create a file (e.g., /etc/security/pwquality-badwords.txt) containing one word per line.
# Uncomment the line below and specify the path to your badwords file.
# badwords = /etc/security/pwquality-badwords.txt

# maxrepeat: Maximum number of allowed consecutive identical characters.
# To address "Repetitive or sequential characters (e.g. aaaaaa)",
# we set a limit to catch obvious repetitions without being overly restrictive.
# A value of 3 means "aaaa" or "1111" would be rejected, but "aaa" is allowed.
maxrepeat = 3

# The following parameters are not explicitly required by the policy,
# or are best left at their defaults to avoid imposing additional,
# non-NIST-recommended composition rules.
# enforce_complexity = 0
# difok = 0
# reject_username = 0
# retry = 3
# ucredit = -1
