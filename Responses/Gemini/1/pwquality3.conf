# Note on other policy rules:
# - Screening against previously compromised passwords is not a direct feature of pam_pwquality.
#   This typically requires integration with external services or specialized PAM modules.
# - Password hints are an organizational policy and not configured within pam_pwquality.conf.
# - Multi-factor authentication and risk-based authentication are broader security policies
#   and require other system components or PAM modules for implementation, not pam_pwquality.conf.
