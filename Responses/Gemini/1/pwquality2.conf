# This file configures the password quality checking for newly created passwords.
# Parameters are based on the provided password policy rules.

# Rule: Passwords must be at least eight characters in length.
# (The 'should be at least 15 characters' is a recommendation, not a strict minimum enforcement for pwquality)
minlen = 8

# Rule: Composition rules for including special characters are no longer required,
# since these often lead to predictable passwords. Long passwords are encouraged over complex ones.
# (Setting these to 0 means no credit/penalty for missing/having these character types,
# emphasizing length over specific character combinations).
lcredit = 0 # No requirement for lowercase characters
ucredit = 0 # No requirement for uppercase characters
dcredit = 0 # No requirement for digits
ocredit = 0 # No requirement for other characters (special characters)

# Rule: Authenticators should monitor newly registered passwords for obvious security weaknesses,
# like common words. (pwquality inherently checks for sequential number strings and dictionary words).
# This parameter enables checking against an additional custom list of "bad words".
# The actual file /etc/security/pwquality_badwords.txt would need to be created and populated
# with a list of forbidden words.
badwords = /etc/security/pwquality_badwords.txt

# Rules not directly configurable in pwquality.conf:
# - "Authenticators should screen new passwords against lists of previously compromised passwords"
#   This functionality typically requires external services or PAM modules (e.g., integration with HIBP).
# - "Organizations should not use password hints"
#   This is an application/UI design guideline, not a pwquality configuration.
# - "Long passwords are encouraged over complex ones. NIST recommends enabling passphrases of up to 64 characters."
#   The encouragement for long passwords is met by setting `minlen` reasonably and removing complexity requirements.
#   Maximum length is typically handled at the application or PAM module level, not by pwquality.conf.
# - "Password-based authentication should be enhanced with multi-factor authentication, and risk-based authentication"
#   This is an architectural and authentication system policy, outside the scope of pwquality.conf.
