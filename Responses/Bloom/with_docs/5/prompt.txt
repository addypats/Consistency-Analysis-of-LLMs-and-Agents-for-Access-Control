Using the documentation at: https://man.archlinux.org/man/pwquality.conf.5.en,
Generate me a /etc/security/pwquality.conf file with the following password policy rules (reply with just the contents of the file):
Always change vendor-supplied defaults (passwords and settings) and remove or disable unnecessary default accounts before installing a system on the network (see 2.1).
Remove/disable inactive user accounts within 90 days (see 8.1.4).
Limit repeated access attempts by locking out the user ID after not more than six attempts (see 8.1.6).
Set the lockout duration to a minimum of 30 minutes or until an administrator enables the user ID (see 8.1.7).
If a session has been idle for more than 15 minutes, require the user to re-authenticate to re-activate the terminal or session (see 8.1.8).
Passwords/passphrases must have a minimum length of 12 characters and must contain both numeric and alphabetic characters. (See 8.3.6)
Passwords should have a minimum length of at least seven characters and contain both numeric and alphabetic characters (see 8.2.3).

Do not allow an individual to submit a new password that is the same as any of the last four passwords/passphrases they have used (see 8.2.5).
Set passwords for first-time use and upon reset to a unique value for each user, and change immediately after the first use (see 8.2.6).
Authenticate user access to assets with at least one of the following methods: password or a passphrase, any biometric method, Smart Card, or an authentication token. These authentication mechanisms must be encrypted during transmission and storage. (see 8.3.1.)
Invalid authentication attempts are limited by: Locking out the user ID after not more than 10 attempts. Setting the lockout duration to a minimum of 30 minutes or until the user’s identity is confirmed. (See 8.3.4)
Individuals are not allowed to submit a new password/passphrase that is the same as any of the last four passwords/passphrases used. (See 8.3.7)
Change passwords/passphrases if there is any suspicion or knowledge that the password/passphrases have been compromised. (See 8.3.8)
Implement and enforce MFA across all access into the CDE and for all remote access and document all MFA access (8.4.1 to 8.5.1)
Passwords must not be hardcoded on scripts and must be periodically changed (8.6.2,8.6.3)
