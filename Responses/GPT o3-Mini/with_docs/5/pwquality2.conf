# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file configures password quality controls. Note that many of the
# overall system password and account management policies (e.g., account
# inactivity removal, lockout policies, session timeout reauthentication,
# password aging, history enforcement, first‐time password settings,
# multifactor authentication, and avoiding hardcoded credentials) must be
# implemented via other system mechanisms (such as PAM modules, login.defs,
# account management tools, and MFA configurations). This file enforces only
# password content quality.
#
# Enforced password quality requirements:
#
# • Passwords/passphrases must have a minimum length of 12 characters.
# • Passwords must include at least one numeric and one alphabetic character.
#
minlen = 12
# Require at least 1 digit.
dcredit = -1
# Require at least 1 lowercase letter.
lcredit = -1

# NOTE: The following policy rules are not configurable through
# pwquality.conf and must be implemented/configured via additional system
# and account management mechanisms:
#
# • Always change vendor-supplied defaults and remove/disable unnecessary default accounts.
# • Remove/disable inactive user accounts within 90 days.
# • Limit repeated access attempts by locking out the user ID after no more than six attempts.
# • Set the lockout duration to a minimum of 30 minutes or until an administrator re-enables the user.
# • Require reauthentication if a session is idle for more than 15 minutes.
# • Passwords should alternatively meet a minimum length of 7 characters (a less-restrictive requirement)
#   where applicable; however, the stronger requirement of 12 characters is used here.
# • Force users to change their passwords at least every 90 days.
# • Prevent new passwords from matching any of the last four used.
# • Set initial/reset passwords to unique values and require an immediate change upon first use.
# • Authenticate user access with encrypted methods (passwords/passphrases, biometrics, smart cards,
#   or authentication tokens) and enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) for all access, including remote.
# • Change passwords immediately if there is any suspicion of compromise.
# • Prohibit hardcoded passwords in scripts and require periodic password changes.
