# The following account and authentication policies are not enforced
# via libpwquality but must be implemented elsewhere in your PAM/system
# configuration:
#
# • Always change vendor-supplied defaults (passwords and settings) and remove or disable
#   unnecessary default accounts before installing a system on the network (see 2.1).
#
# • Remove/disable inactive user accounts within 90 days (see 8.1.4).
#
# • Limit repeated access attempts by locking out the user ID after not more than six attempts
#   (see 8.1.6).
#
# • Set the lockout duration to a minimum of 30 minutes or until an administrator enables the user ID
#   (see 8.1.7).
#
# • If a session has been idle for more than 15 minutes, require the user to re-authenticate to
#   re-activate the terminal or session (see 8.1.8).
#
# • For alternative password policies (e.g., a less stringent minimum length of 7 characters with both
#   numeric and alphabetic characters), ensure that only one global policy is active.
#
# • Change user passwords at least once every 90 days (see 8.2.4).
#
# • Set passwords for first-time use and upon reset to a unique value for each user, and force an
#   immediate change after first use (see 8.2.6).
#
# • Authenticate user access with at least one approved method (password/passphrase, biometrics,
#   Smart Card, or an authentication token), ensuring that authentication data is encrypted in
#   transit and at rest (see 8.3.1).
#
# • Limit invalid authentication attempts by locking out user IDs after not more than 10 attempts and/or
#   enforcing a minimum 30-minute lockout until the user’s identity is verified (see 8.3.4).
#
# • Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all access into the CDE and for all remote access,
#   documenting all MFA access (see 8.4.1 to 8.5.1).
#
# • Ensure passwords are not hardcoded in scripts and are periodically changed (see 8.6.2, 8.6.3).
