# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file contains settings for the password quality module.
# Note: Several of the requested policy rules (such as account inactivity, lockout,
# re-authentication on idle, password aging/history, MFA, and non-hardcoding of passwords)
# cannot be enforced via pwquality. They must be implemented via other PAM modules and
# additional system configuration. This file only governs password composition.
#
# Enforced password quality rules:
#
# 1. Passwords/passphrases must have a minimum length of 12 characters and contain both
#    numeric and alphabetic characters. (See 8.3.6)
#
#    (Note: A less strict requirement of at least 7 characters is mentioned elsewhere,
#     however this configuration uses the stronger 12‐character minimum.)
#
minlen = 12
#
# 2. Require at least one digit.
#
dcredit = -1
#
# 3. Require at least one lowercase letter (satisfies the alphabetic requirement).
#
lcredit = -1
#
# The following policies must be enforced by other means (PAM modules, system configuration,
# account policies, etc.):
#
# • Change vendor-supplied defaults and disable unnecessary default accounts before installation.
# • Remove/disable inactive user accounts within 90 days.
# • Lock out the user ID after no more than six repeated access attempts.
# • Set the lockout duration to a minimum of 30 minutes or until an administrator re-enables the account.
# • Require re-authentication if a session is idle for more than 15 minutes.
# • Change user passwords at least every 90 days.
# • Prevent reuse of any of the last four passwords.
# • Set temporary, unique passwords for first-time use and on password reset, with mandatory change at first login.
# • Enforce and document multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all access.
# • Prohibit hardcoding passwords in scripts and require periodic password changes.
#
# Please configure these additional policies using the appropriate PAM modules (e.g.,
# pam_faillock, pam_tally2, pam_pwhistory) and system account management tools.
