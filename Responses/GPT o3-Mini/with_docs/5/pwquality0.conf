# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This configuration file is used by the pam_pwquality module to enforce
# password quality settings. It does not control all aspects of the overall
# password and account lifecycle. Other requirements (such as account
# disablement, inactivity removal, lockout policies, forced password changes,
# password history, multifactor authentication, etc.) must be implemented in
# the appropriate system or PAM configuration files.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Password Composition Requirements
#
# Rule: "Passwords/passphrases must have a minimum length of 12 characters
# and must contain both numeric and alphabetic characters." (see 8.3.6)
#
# Rule: "Passwords should have a minimum length of at least seven characters
# and contain both numeric and alphabetic characters" (see 8.2.3)
#
# For consistency and security, we enforce the stricter 12-character minimum.
#
minlen = 12
#
# To require at least one numeric digit, set dcredit to -1.
dcredit = -1
#
# To require at least one alphabetic character, we enforce at least one lowercase
# letter. (An uppercase requirement can be added if desired.)
lcredit = -1
#
# No explicit requirement is set for uppercase letters.
ucredit = 0
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Notes on Other Policy Requirements
#
# The following policies are not handled by pam_pwquality and must be
# implemented elsewhere:
#
# • Vendor-supplied defaults must always be changed and unnecessary default
#   accounts removed or disabled before installation. (see 2.1)
#
# • Inactive user accounts should be removed or disabled within 90 days. (see 8.1.4)
#
# • Limit repeated access attempts by locking out the user ID after not more
#   than six attempts (or ten attempts as per other guidance) and set the lockout
#   duration to a minimum of 30 minutes (or until re-enabled by an administrator).
#   (see 8.1.6, 8.1.7, 8.3.4)
#
# • Sessions idle for more than 15 minutes should require re-authentication.
#   (see 8.1.8)
#
# • User passwords must be changed at least once every 90 days. (see 8.2.4)
#
# • Do not allow a new password that matches any of the last four previously used
#   passwords/passphrases. (see 8.2.5 and 8.3.7)
#
# • First-time and reset passwords must be uniquely set and require immediate
#   change on first use. (see 8.2.6)
#
# • User access must be authenticated using strong methods (passwords,
#   biometric methods, smart cards, or authentication tokens) with encrypted
#   transmission and storage. (see 8.3.1)
#
# • Change passwords/passphrases promptly if there is any suspicion of compromise.
#   (see 8.3.8)
#
# • Multifactor authentication (MFA) should be implemented and enforced for
#   all access, including remote access, with appropriate documentation. (see
#   8.4.1 to 8.5.1)
#
# • Passwords must not be hardcoded in scripts and must be periodically changed.
#   (see 8.6.2, 8.6.3)
#
# Please ensure that these policies are configured using the appropriate tools,
# modules, and system settings beyond the pwquality configuration.
