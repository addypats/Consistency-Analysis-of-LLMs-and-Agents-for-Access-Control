# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# The following settings enforce password complexity requirements.
#
# Rule (8.3.6): Passwords/passphrases must have a minimum length of 12 characters
# and must contain both numeric and alphabetic characters.
minlen = 12
dcredit = -1     # Require at least one digit
lcredit = -1     # Require at least one lowercase letter
#
# NOTE: The password policy also calls for many additional controls that are not
# handled by pam_pwquality. These include:
#
# • Changing vendor-supplied defaults and disabling unnecessary default accounts (2.1).
# • Removing/disabling inactive user accounts within 90 days (8.1.4).
# • Locking out a user ID after no more than six repeated access attempts (8.1.6).
# • Enforcing a lockout duration of at least 30 minutes or until an administrator re-enables the account (8.1.7).
# • Re-authenticating sessions idle for more than 15 minutes (8.1.8).
# • Enforcing a minimum password length of at least seven characters in some contexts (8.2.3).
# • Changing user passwords at least once every 90 days (8.2.4).
# • Preventing reuse of any of the last four passwords/passphrases (8.2.5, 8.3.7).
# • Setting initial or reset passwords to a unique value and forcing change upon first use (8.2.6).
# • Ensuring authentication methods (e.g., password/passphrase, biometric,
#   Smart Card, or token) are encrypted during transmission and storage (8.3.1).
# • Limiting invalid authentication attempts to lock out the user ID after 10 tries
#   with a lockout duration of at least 30 minutes (8.3.4).
# • Forcing password changes when a compromise is suspected (8.3.8).
# • Implementing and enforcing MFA for all access (8.4.1–8.5.1).
# • Preventing hardcoded passwords in scripts and mandating periodic changes (8.6.2, 8.6.3).
#
# The extra requirements above must be implemented through additional PAM modules
# and system configuration files, not via this pwquality configuration.
