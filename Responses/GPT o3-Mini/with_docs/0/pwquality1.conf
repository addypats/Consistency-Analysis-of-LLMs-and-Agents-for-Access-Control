# NOTE:
# - The policy “Passwords must be changed every 90 days” must be enforced
#   via system password aging settings (for example, in /etc/login.defs or via
#   pam_unix) rather than through pwquality.
#
# - The rule “Passwords cannot be reused for 1 year” is also not handled by
#   pwquality. Use pam_pwhistory or an equivalent mechanism to enforce this.
#
# - Ensuring that passwords are not easily tied to the account owner (e.g.,
#   by avoiding social security numbers, birth dates, or relatives’ names) is
#   not directly configurable here and should be managed through user training
#   and additional application-specific checks.
