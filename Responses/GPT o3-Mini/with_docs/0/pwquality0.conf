# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file is used by the PAM pwquality module to enforce password quality requirements.
#
# Note: Some requested policies (password aging and reuse restrictions) are not handled
# by pwquality. To enforce a 90‐day password change interval and a 1‐year password reuse
# policy, please use the appropriate PAM modules (e.g. pam_unix, pam_pwhistory) and settings
# in /etc/login.defs or via chage.
#
# Policy Rules Implemented Below:
#
#  - Minimum password length of 10 characters.
#  - Passwords must include characters from at least three of the following four classes:
#      lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and other (special) characters.
#    (This ensures the use of alphabetic, numeric, and special characters.)
#  - Reject passwords that include the username.
#  - Dictionary check enabled to help avoid dictionary words or acronyms.
#
minlen = 10
minclass = 3

# Require at least one digit
dcredit = -1

# Require at least one special character.
# (Allowed special characters include: !@#$%^&*_+=?/~’;’,<>|\ )
ocredit = -1

# Enable dictionary-based password check (to limit dictionary words/acronyms)
dictcheck = 1

# Prevent using the username as part of the password.
reject_username = 1

# Note: Password aging (every 90 days) and password reuse restriction (avoid reuse within 1 year)
# must be configured elsewhere (e.g., via PAM's pam_unix and pam_pwhistory modules, /etc/login.defs,
# and /etc/shadow).
