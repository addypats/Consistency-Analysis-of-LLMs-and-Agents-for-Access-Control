# - Enforcing a 90‚Äêday maximum password age is not handled by pam_pwquality.
#   Please configure password aging (e.g. via /etc/login.defs or chage) separately.
# - Preventing passwords from containing personal user information is
#   partially enforced via the reject_username option.
# - Preventing reuse for one year is approximated here by remembering the last four passwords,
#   assuming password changes occur roughly every 90 days.
