# NIST SP 800-63B-aligned baseline:
# - Minimum length: 8 for user-chosen memorized secrets
# - No additional composition/complexity requirements
# - Allow long passphrases (do not truncate)
#
# NOTE: pwquality cannot implement blacklist checks, Unicode normalization,
# rate limiting, password hints policy, or breached-password screening.
# Those must be handled by the application/PAM stack and supporting tooling.
