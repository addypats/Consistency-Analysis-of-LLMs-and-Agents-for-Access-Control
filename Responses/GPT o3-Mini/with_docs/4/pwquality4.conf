# This file configures the quality requirements for subscriber‐chosen
# memorized secrets (i.e. passwords). In accordance with the policy rules,
# only a minimum length requirement is enforced and no additional
# composition rules (such as requiring a mix of character types) are imposed.
#
# Subscriber‐chosen memorized secrets MUST be at least 8 characters in length.
minlen = 8

# Do not require extra “credits” for digits, uppercase, lowercase, or other symbols.
# This prevents imposing complexity requirements beyond the minimum length.

# Check against a list of commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords.
# If the prospective secret is found in the provided blacklist, it will be rejected.

# Prevent implicit allowance of the username within the password.

# Disable restrictions on consecutively repeated characters.
# (No composition rules requiring a limit on repetition are imposed.)
maxrepeat = 0

# Note:
# - Passwords MAY contain any printing ASCII or Unicode characters.
# - No transformations (such as truncation) of the secret are performed.
# - Unicode secrets should be normalized (e.g. via NFKC or NFKD) prior to
#   hashing by the verifier.
# - Additional measures (such as rate limiting for failed attempts) must be
#   implemented elsewhere in the verifier’s authentication system.
