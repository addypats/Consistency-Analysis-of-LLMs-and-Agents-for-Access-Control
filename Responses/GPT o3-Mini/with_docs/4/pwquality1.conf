# This configuration implements a policy where subscriber‐chosen
# memorized secrets (passwords or PINs) must be at least 8 characters long.
# No additional complexity/composition requirements are enforced.
#
# Option "minlen" specifies the minimum length for a user–chosen memorized secret.
minlen = 8

# Do not require a minimum number of distinct character classes.

# Enable dictionary/blacklist checking against common, expected, or compromised values.
# If a prospective secret is found in the maintained list (or dictionary),
# the password change must be rejected and the user advised to choose a different secret.
dictcheck = 1
#
# Note:
# - Memorized secrets generated by the verifier (e.g., random passwords or PINs)
#   may be permitted with a lower length (e.g. 6 characters) by the CSP,
#   but this configuration applies to subscriber–chosen secrets.
#
# - There is no imposed maximum length here, allowing subscriber–chosen secrets
#   of at least 64 characters, in line with guidance, and all printing ASCII
#   and Unicode characters are acceptable.
#
# - Other composition rules (e.g. mandatory mixtures, prohibiting sequential/repeated characters)
#   are intentionally not implemented in this configuration.
