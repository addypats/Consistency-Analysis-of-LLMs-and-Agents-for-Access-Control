# Aligned with NIST SP 800-63B guidance:
# - Minimum length for user-chosen passwords: 8
# - Do not impose composition rules (no class requirements, no credits/penalties)
# - Do not reject based on repeated/sequential/etc. patterns here (handled via blacklist elsewhere)
# - Do not enforce arbitrary periodic changes here (not a pwquality setting)
#
# Note: pwquality cannot implement blacklist checking, rate limiting, Unicode normalization,
# or "allow up to 64+" by itself; those must be handled by PAM modules/applications and system config.
