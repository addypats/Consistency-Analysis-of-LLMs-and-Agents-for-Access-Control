# Note:
# • Memorized secrets chosen randomly (by the verifier or CSP) may be as short as 6 characters.
#   This configuration does not apply to those automatically generated values.
#
# • Subscribers are permitted to choose secret values up to 64 characters in length.
#
# • All printable ASCII characters and Unicode code points (after proper normalization)
#   are acceptable.
#
# • No additional composition rules (e.g. requiring mixtures of character types or banning
#   sequential/repetitive characters) are imposed.
#
# • It is expected that the system’s higher-level authentication component implements
#   rate-limiting and other account protection mechanisms.
#
# This configuration is intended to support the policy requirements for memorized secrets.
