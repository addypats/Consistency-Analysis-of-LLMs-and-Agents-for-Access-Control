# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This configuration is intended to enforce a minimalist memorized secret policy.
# Subscriber‐chosen secrets MUST be at least 8 characters long. No additional
# composition or complexity requirements (such as requiring a mix of character types)
# are imposed. Instead, a dictionary-based check is enabled to disallow secrets known
# to be commonly-used, expected, or compromised.
#
# Note:
# • Randomly generated secrets (by the CSP or verifier) may be shorter (at least 6 characters)
#   and entirely numeric; however, this file governs subscriber‐chosen secrets.
# • Input normalization (e.g. using NFKC/NFKD) is recommended by policy but is not handled
#   here. Such processing should occur prior to password verification.
#
# Minimum length for subscriber‐chosen memorized secrets (must be at least 8 characters).
minlen = 8

# Do not require digits, uppercase, lowercase, or other character types
# (set credits to 0 to avoid enforcing composition rules).
ucredit = 0
lcredit = 0
dcredit = 0
ocredit = 0

# Do not disallow repeated characters (i.e. do not impose a rule against repeated or sequential
# characters beyond the minimum length); setting maxrepeat to 0 disables this check.
maxrepeat = 0

# Enable a dictionary (blacklist) based check.
# If the proposed secret appears in the dictionary of compromised or trivial values,
# it will be rejected.
dictcheck = 1
dictpath = /usr/share/cracklib/pw_dict

# End of configuration.
