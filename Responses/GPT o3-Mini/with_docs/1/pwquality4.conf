# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This configuration file implements our password policy requirements.
#
# 1. Password length: Although a minimum of 8 characters is required,
#    we enforce a length of 15 characters to encourage the use of passphrases.
minlen = 15
#
# 2. Dictionary check: Enable dictionary checking to flag obvious words
#    (e.g. "password") and other common patterns.
dictcheck = 1
#
# 3. Sequential patterns: Limit sequential characters (for example, “123456”)
#    by disallowing sequences longer than 3 characters.
maxsequence = 3
#
# 4. Composition rules: Do not require the inclusion of special characters,
#    uppercase letters, digits, or other character classes. This avoids forcing
#    predictable complexity rules. (All these are set to 0 to disable extra credit.)
minclass = 0
dcredit = 0
ucredit = 0
lcredit = 0
ocredit = 0
#
# 5. Passphrases: Long passwords are encouraged over complex ones.
#    NIST recommends enabling passphrases of up to 64 characters.
#    (Ensure that your system modules support passwords up to this length.)
# maxlen = 64
#
# 6. Breached-password screening: New passwords should be checked against lists
#    of previously compromised passwords. If an external breached-passwords
#    service is available, configure it here.
# breached_passwords = /etc/security/compromised_passwords.txt
#
# 7. Additional security measures: Password-based authentication should be
#    enhanced with multi-factor authentication and risk-based techniques.
#    (These measures must be configured within the appropriate authentication modules.)
