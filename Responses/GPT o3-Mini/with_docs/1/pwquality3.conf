# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This configuration enforces a modern password policy. Passwords must be
# at least eight characters in length; however, to encourage passphrases,
# a minimum length of 15 characters is required.
minlen = 15

# Enable dictionary checking to help catch obviously weak choices,
# such as the common word "password". This check warns against passwords
# that are simple or found in a list of common words.
dictcheck = 1

# Note: While libpwquality does not automatically detect sequential number
# strings, administrators should deploy complementary monitoring or policy
# tools to warn about or reject passwords with obvious patterns.
#
# In addition, checking new passwords against lists of previously compromised
# passwords (breach-detection) is highly recommended. If your version of
# libpwquality supports it, enable the breachcheck option:
# breachcheck = 1
#
# No password hints should be provided by the system, as such hints can reveal
# important clues to potential attackers. (This is handled by other system-wide
# settings outside of pwquality.conf.)
#
# The traditional requirement to include a mix of upper, lower, digits, and
# special characters has been deprecated in favor of encouraging long, easy-to-remember
# passphrases. As such, the following composition requirements are effectively disabled.
dcredit = 0
ucredit = 0
lcredit = 0
ocredit = 0

# While libpwquality does not enforce a maximum length beyond internal limits,
# administrators are encouraged to allow passphrases up to 64 characters in length,
# in line with NIST recommendations.
maxlen = 64

# Note: The use of multifactor authentication and risk-based methods to enhance
# password-based authentication is beyond the scope of pwquality. Please ensure
# that these additional layers are implemented with other security tools and
# system configurations.
