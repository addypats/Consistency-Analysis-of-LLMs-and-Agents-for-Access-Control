# Additional Security Recommendations:
#
# • Screen new passwords against lists of previously compromised passwords.
#   (Implementing this may require an external module or service.)
#
# • Avoid using password hints since these can inadvertently provide attackers with clues.
#
# • Enhance password authentication with multi-factor authentication (MFA)
#   and risk-based authentication techniques wherever possible.
#
# These recommendations are not enforced by pwquality but should be implemented
# by supplemental security measures.
