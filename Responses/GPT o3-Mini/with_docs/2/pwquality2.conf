#
# Password quality settings for PAM’s pwquality module.
#
# Note: Some items of your password policy (e.g., mandatory password changes every 90 days,
# the minimum interval of two days between password changes, and guidance about sharing or
# storing passwords) are not enforced by pam_pwquality. They must be implemented through
# other mechanisms such as system policy settings, administrative procedures, or user education.
#
# The following settings enforce:
# • A minimum password length of 8 characters.
# • At least one numeric character.
# • At least one alphabetic character (a lowercase letter is required).
# • Rejection of passwords based on dictionary words and those that contain the user name.
#
minlen = 8
dcredit = -1       # Require at least one digit
lcredit = -1       # Require at least one lowercase letter (ensures at least one alphabetic character)
dictcheck = 1      # Check against words in the dictionary (see dictpath)
reject_username = 1
