# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file is used by the PAM pwquality module to enforce password complexity.
#
# Note: Policies regarding password expiration (change at least every 90 days),
# password reuse (only allow changing once every two days), not emailing or sharing
# passwords, and secure storage (no plaintext or unencrypted storage) are not
# enforced by pwquality but should be implemented via other system configuration
# or administrative policies.
#
# The following settings enforce the complexity rules:
#
# 1. Passwords must be at least 8 characters long.
minlen = 8
#
# 2. Passwords must contain at least 1 numeric character.
#    (A negative value indicates that at least one digit is required.)
dcredit = -1
#
# 3. Passwords must contain at least 1 alphabetic character.
#    While pwquality does not have a single setting for “any letter,” the following
#    settings require that the password contains both an uppercase and a lowercase letter.
#    (This is a stricter requirement than “at least one alpha” but ensures that
#     at least one letter is present.)
ucredit = -1
lcredit = -1
#
# 4. Passwords should not be based on a dictionary word.
dictcheck = 1
#
# 5. Passwords must not be part of your name or user name.
reject_username = 1
