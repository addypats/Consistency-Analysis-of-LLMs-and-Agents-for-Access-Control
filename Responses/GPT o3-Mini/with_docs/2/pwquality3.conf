# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file configures password quality settings.
#
# Policy Rules (also to be enforced by organizational procedures):
# 1. All passwords must be changed at least every 90 days.
# 2. Passwords must not be inserted into email messages or other forms of electronic communication,
#    and should not be shared with anyone.
# 3. Passwords should not be written down or stored electronically without encryption.
# 4. All passwords must be at least 8 characters long, contain at least 1 alphabetic and 1 numeric
#    character, must not be based on a dictionary word, and must not be part of your name or user name.
# 5. Passwords can only be changed once every two days.
#
# Note:
# Many of the above requirements are enforced by organizational policy or additional system tools.
# The settings below enforce the complexity requirements.
