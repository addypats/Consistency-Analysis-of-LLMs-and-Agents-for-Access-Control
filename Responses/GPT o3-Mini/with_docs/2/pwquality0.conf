# The following guidelines reflect organizational policies. Note that some
# requirements (password expiration, minimum time between changes, and keeping
# passwords off of electronic communications or unencrypted storage) must be
# enforced via additional system configuration (for example, with password aging
# settings in /etc/login.defs or PAM configuration) and by user training.
#
# Organizational password policy guidelines:
#  • All passwords must be changed at least every 90 days.
#  • Password changes are allowed only once every two days.
#  • Passwords must not be inserted into email messages or any other form
#    of electronic communication.
#  • Passwords should not be written down or stored electronically without
#    encryption.
#
# Requirements for password composition:
#  • Must be at least 8 characters long.
#  • Must contain at least one alphabetic character (a–z).
#    (Lowercase letters are required; uppercase letters are optional.)
#  • Must contain at least one numeric digit.
#  • Should not be based on a dictionary word.
#  • Should not include the user’s name or username.
