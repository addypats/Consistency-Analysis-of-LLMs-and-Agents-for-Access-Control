# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This configuration is intended to complement a larger account‐security policy.
#
# IMPORTANT: Certain requirements (e.g. mandatory MFA, session inactivity lock,
# temporary lockout with throttling, alerting on repeated failures, and automatic
# account suspension) cannot be enforced by pam_pwquality alone. They must be
# implemented via additional PAM modules (such as pam_faillock), systemd settings,
# login.defs, or external scripts. The settings below address only those aspects
# directly supported by pwquality.conf.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MFA recommendation:
#   Administrators should enable multifactor authentication wherever possible.
#   (See section 2.1 of the policy documentation.)
#
# Minimum length requirements:
#   - For password‐only accounts, a minimum length of 14 characters is required.
#   - For MFA‐enabled accounts, a minimum of 8 characters is acceptable.
#
# Since pam_pwquality does not support per‐account conditional settings, set the
# stricter minimum length here. For MFA-enabled accounts, consider a separate PAM
# stack or policy that allows minlen=8.
minlen = 14
#
# Maximum length:
#   Do not impose an artificial maximum password length here; the system’s
#   inherent constraints will apply.
#   (No “maxlen” setting is provided, meaning passwords can be as long as allowed.)
#
# Character requirements:
#   The policy should allow all character types but require at least one non‐alphabetic
#   character (digit or punctuation) for password‐only accounts. Since pam_pwquality
#   cannot require “non‐alphabetic” in an OR sense, we enforce at least one digit as a
#   proxy. (Note: This does not count a punctuation character, so in environments where
#   users might use only punctuation for their non‐alphabetic element, consider alternative
#   measures.)
dcredit = -1
# (If you prefer to require a punctuation character instead, you could use:
# ocredit = -1
# but that would force digits to be optional rather than providing an OR capability.)
#
# Password expiration and history:
#   To force a password change immediately after a breach (and a backstop annual
#   expiration), integrate these rules via PAM modules (e.g. pam_unix with parameter
#   “maxdays”) and account management tools. Here we document the desired settings.
#
#   For example, in /etc/login.defs one might set:
#       PASS_MAX_DAYS   365
#       PASS_MIN_DAYS   1
#
#   And in the PAM configuration for password history, require checking against:
#     • an internal deny list (of at least 20 known bad or weak passwords) and
#     • the previous 5 passwords.
#
#   (pam_pwquality itself supports a “dictpath” option for a wordlist, but integration
#   with history tracking must be accomplished via pam_pwhistory.)
dictpath = /usr/share/cracklib/pw_dict
#
# Note: The deny list file specified above should contain at least 20 common weak
# passwords. Ensure that pam_pwhistory is configured to remember the last 5 passwords.
#
# Password change delay:
#   A minimum delay of 1 day between password changes should be enforced via PAM
#   (e.g. using pam_unix’s “mindays” setting). (See section 5.1.4.)
#
# Session and account lockout policies:
#   The following policies must be implemented outside of pam_pwquality:
#
#   - Lock the current session after 15 minutes (or less) of inactivity.
#   - Apply a temporary account lockout (15 minutes or more) after five consecutive
#     failed login attempts.
#   - Enforce time-doubling throttling (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, … minutes between attempts)
#     with a permanent lockout (IT reset required) after 12 retries.
#   - Monitor and alert key personnel when bad login attempts reach the configured
#     limit.
#   - Automatically suspend accounts after 45 days without a valid login.
#   - Disallow user-defined password “hints” at login.
#
# These settings should be applied using the appropriate PAM modules (for example,
# pam_faillock), systemd service configurations, and/or custom security scripts.
#
# End of /etc/security/pwquality.conf
