# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file is intended to support our overall password policy.
# Note that several of the following requirements (MFA integration,
# account expiration, login throttling/lockout, history checks, session locking,
# monitoring/alerting, and preventing user‐defined password hints)
# must be implemented via additional PAM modules or external system tools.
#
# 1. MFA Usage
#    ------------------------------
#    Enforce multi‐factor authentication wherever possible.
#    (Ensure MFA is enabled via your PAM configuration – this file does not handle MFA directly.)
#
# 2. Minimum Password Length
#    ------------------------------
#    For password‐only accounts, require a minimum length of 14 characters.
#    For MFA‐enabled accounts, a minimum of 8 characters is acceptable.
#    (The “minlen” below applies by default to password‐only accounts.
#     Configure separate PAM rules for MFA–enabled accounts as needed.)
minlen = 14
#
# 3. Maximum Password Length
#    ------------------------------
#    Do not impose an artificial maximum length; allow the maximum
#    permitted by system constraints.
#    (No “maxlen” parameter is set.)
#
# 4. Character Requirements
#    ------------------------------
#    Allow all character types.
#    For password–only accounts, require at least one non–alphabetic character.
#    (A negative “dcredit” forces at least one digit. You may adjust or add
#     an “ocredit” requirement if you wish to count punctuation characters.)
dcredit = -1
ucredit = 0
lcredit = 0
ocredit = 0
#
# 5. Breach Response and Expiration
#    ------------------------------
#    Immediately force a password change upon a detected breach,
#    with an annual expiration as a backstop.
#    (Enforce this via your PAM and shadow file or account policy settings.)
#
# 6. Deny List and Password History
#    ------------------------------
#    On new password creation, check against an internal deny list of
#    known weak passwords (~20 common passwords) and reject if the new password
#    matches any of the previous 5 passwords.
#    (Implement these checks using pam_pwhistory and/or external dictionary modules.)
#
# 7. Password Change Delay
#    ------------------------------
#    Enforce a password change delay of at least one day between changes.
#    (This delay must be configured via PAM/account management, not in pwquality.conf.)
#
# 8. Session Locking for Inactivity
#    ------------------------------
#    Automatically lock the current session after 15 minutes (or less) of inactivity.
#    (This is typically managed by session or screensaver settings.)
#
# 9. Temporary Account Lockout on Failed Attempts
#    ------------------------------
#    Lock the account temporarily (15 minutes or more) after five consecutive failed attempts.
#    Additionally, enforce time–doubling throttling between retries (e.g. delays of 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, … minutes)
#    with a permanent lockout (requiring an IT reset) after 12 retries.
#    (These measures must be set up via appropriate PAM modules such as pam_tally2 or pam_faillock.)
#
# 10. Monitoring and Alerting
#    ------------------------------
#    Monitor and alert key personnel when failed login attempts reach the login limit.
#    (This requires integration with your system logging and alerting infrastructure.)
#
# 11. Inactivity Account Suspension
#    ------------------------------
#    Automatically suspend the account after 45 days without a valid login.
#    (Implement using account management tools like “chage” or equivalent.)
#
# 12. Password Hints
#    ------------------------------
#    Do not allow user-defined password hints at login.
#    (Ensure your login system is configured to disable this feature.)
#
# End of policy configuration.
#
# Note: Only parameters supported by pam_pwquality are listed below.
# The rest of the controls must be implemented via PAM, account, and system configuration.
