# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file sets password quality requirements. Note that several of the
# rules (MFA requirements, password expiration, history, lockouts, inactivity
# timeouts, login throttling, account suspension, and password‐hint restrictions)
# must be configured via other PAM or system security modules.
#
# PASSWORD LENGTH:
#   - Accounts using MFA are required to have at least 8 characters;
#   - Password-only accounts (without MFA) must have at least 14 characters.
# Since pwquality.conf cannot conditionally enforce two minimum lengths,
# we set the base minimum to 8 and rely on additional PAM configuration to
# enforce a 14-character minimum for non‐MFA accounts.
minlen = 8
#
# CHARACTER CLASS REQUIREMENTS:
#   To allow all character types while ensuring that password-only accounts
#   include at least one non‐alphabetic character, we require at least two
#   different character classes. (This forces a mix of alphabetic and non‐alphabetic.)
minclass = 2
#
# MAXIMUM LENGTH:
#   Do not impose any artificial upper bound. Password length is limited only
#   by system constraints, so no maximum length parameter is set.
#
# DICTIONARY CHECK:
#   When using a suitable library (such as cracklib) for checking against a deny list
#   of common or weak passwords, ensure that the dictionary file covering at least
#   20 common passwords is in place. (Note that checking previous 5 passwords
#   and enforcing a delay between changes are typically configured via pam_pwhistory.)
dictpath = /usr/share/cracklib/pw_dict
#
# THE REMAINDER OF THE POLICY RULES:
#   - Immediate password change in the event of a breach, with annual expiration,
#     is enforced via external password management procedures.
#
#   - Checks against an internal deny list (including 20 common weak passwords and the
#     previous 5 passwords) and a minimum delay of one day between changes are handled by
#     pam_pwhistory and other PAM modules.
#
#   - Automatic session locking after 15 minutes (or less) of inactivity,
#     temporary account lockouts after five failed attempts with exponential (time doubling)
#     delays between retries, and permanent administrative resets after 12 failures are
#     implemented via separate PAM/login and account management configurations.
#
#   - Monitoring/alerting on excessive failed login attempts, automatic suspension after
#     45 days without a valid login, and prohibition of user-defined password hints are also
#     managed outside of pwquality.
#
# End of /etc/security/pwquality.conf
