# Enable multifactor authentication wherever possible.
# NOTE: MFA configuration is handled in PAM and other system components,
# not in this pwquality configuration file.

# For password quality, we enforce different minimum lengths depending on account type.
# - MFA-enabled accounts: minimum length 8 characters.
# - Password‐only accounts: minimum length 14 characters.
# Since pwquality.conf cannot conditionally set “minlen” based on MFA status,
# the default here is for MFA-enabled accounts. For password–only accounts, adjust the PAM stack accordingly.
minlen = 8

# Do not restrict the maximum length of passwords.
# (No maxlen option is specified, allowing the maximum length to be determined by system constraints.)

# Enforce that a password is not composed solely of alphabetic characters.
# This rule requires that at least one character be non–alphabetic
# when letters are used. Setting minclass to 2 means that at least two character classes
# (from lowercase, uppercase, digits, and other characters) are required.
# Note: Passwords composed entirely of non–letters (e.g. all digits) are not affected.
minclass = 2

# The credit parameters below are set to zero so that characters from any class
# are allowed without extra credit. They do not restrict the use of any character type.
dcredit = 0
ucredit = 0
lcredit = 0
ocredit = 0

# Immediate password change upon breach and an annual expiration backstop
# must be implemented via PAM or other system utilities (for example using chage);
# they are not handled in this configuration file.

# New password checks against a deny list of known weak or common passwords
# (including at least 20 common passwords) should use a dictionary.
# Adjust the dictpath below to point to a file containing common disallowed passwords.
dictpath = /usr/share/dict/cracklib-small
# NOTE: Enforcement of rejecting any of the previous 5 passwords must be configured via
# appropriate PAM modules (e.g. pam_unix) rather than in pwquality.conf.

# A minimum delay of one day between password changes, session auto–lock after 15 minutes
# of inactivity, temporary account lockout after five consecutive failed attempts,
# time–doubling throttling between retries with permanent lockout after 12 failures,
# alerting on exceeding bad login attempts, automatic account suspension after 45 days of inactivity,
# and prevention of user–defined password hints are outside the scope of pwquality.
# Please configure these security measures with the relevant PAM modules (such as pam_faillock, pam_limits)
# and system settings.

# End of /etc/security/pwquality.conf
