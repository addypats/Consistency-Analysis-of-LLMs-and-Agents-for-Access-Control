# /etc/security/pwquality.conf - Password Quality Configuration File
#
# 1. Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)
#    -----------------------------------
#    Enforce MFA wherever possible. This file governs only the password quality;
#    ensure MFA is enabled and configured via the appropriate PAM modules or system settings.
#
# 2. Password Length Requirements
#    -----------------------------
#    For password‐only accounts a minimum length of 14 characters is required.
#    For MFA-enabled accounts a minimum length of 8 characters may be acceptable.
#    (Configure the MFA-enabled account policy separately; this file applies the stricter policy.)
minlen = 14
#
# 3. Maximum Password Length
#    --------------------------
#    No maximum password length is imposed here. The effective maximum is determined
#    by system constraints.
#
# 4. Character Composition Rules
#    -----------------------------
#    All character types may be used.
#    For password‐only accounts, force at least one character that is not alphabetic.
minnonalpha = 1
#
# 5. Password Expiration
#    --------------------
#    In the event of a breach the user should be forced to change the password immediately,
#    and an annual expiration is set as a backstop.
#    (This policy is typically enforced via password aging and PAM modules, not by pwquality.)
#
# 6. Deny List and Password Reuse
#    -----------------------------
#    On new password creation, check against an internal deny list containing at least
#    20 common or weak passwords, as well as the user's 5 previous passwords.
#    The dictionary file below should contain the list of disallowed passwords.
dictpath = /etc/security/pwquality.deny
#
# 7. Password Change Delay
#    -----------------------
#    Enforce a minimum delay of 1 day between password changes.
#    (This is implemented via system account and PAM history settings.)
#
# 8. Session Inactivity Lockout
#    ----------------------------
#    The current session should lock after 15 minutes (or less) of inactivity.
#    (This is managed by session timeout settings in the window manager or display manager.)
#
# 9. Temporary Account Lockout and Retry Throttling
#    -----------------------------------------------
#    After 5 consecutive failed login attempts, a temporary lockout of at least 15 minutes
#    is enforced. Additionally, implement doubling time delays between subsequent retries
#    (e.g. 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, etc. minutes), with a permanent lockout (requiring IT reset) after 12 retries.
#    (These measures are typically configured in PAM’s faillock or similar modules.)
#
# 10. Alerting on Excessive Failed Logins
#     -------------------------------------
#     When failed login attempts reach the configured limit, key personnel should be alerted.
#     (This must be enabled via log monitoring and alerting systems external to pwquality.)
#
# 11. Account Suspension on Inactivity
#     ----------------------------------
#     Automatically suspend the account after 45 days without a valid login.
#     (Account inactivity is handled via system account policies, not here.)
#
# 12. Disallow Password Hints at Login
#     ----------------------------------
#     Users are not allowed to define password hints at login.
#     (This should be disabled in the login interface settings.)
#
# 13. Additional Settings
#     ---------------------
#     Ensure that the new password does not contain the username.
reject_username = 1
#
# Note: Many of the above security policies are implemented via PAM modules,
#       system account settings, or external monitoring tools rather than within
#       the pwquality configuration. Adjust those components accordingly.
