# Note: This file controls password quality requirements. Some policy
# aspects – such as mandatory password changes every 90 days and preventing
# reuse for one year – must be configured via PAM settings (e.g., /etc/login.defs,
# /etc/pam.d/common-password, and the pam_pwhistory module).

# Enforce a minimum password length of 10 characters.
minlen = 10

# Ensure the new password contains at least one digit.

# Ensure the new password contains at least one special (non-alphanumeric) character.
ocredit = -1
#
# Enforce that passwords originate from at least three distinct character classes.
# This helps ensure a combination of alphabetic (alpha), numeric, and special characters.
minclass = 3
#
# Check the new password against a dictionary to discourage the use of
# dictionary words or common acronyms.

# Reject passwords that include the username to help prevent ties to the account owner.

# Note: Password aging (e.g., changing every 90 days) and password history
# (e.g., disallowing reuse for one year) must be set in the appropriate PAM
# configuration files (such as using the pam_unix option "remember") and/or
# system account settings.
