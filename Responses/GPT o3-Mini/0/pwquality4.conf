# Note:
# - Password expiration (90 days) and password history (no reuse for 1 year) are NOT enforced by
#   pwquality; configure them in /etc/login.defs and PAM (pam_unix.so remember=..., pwhistory),
#   or via your system's password aging tools (e.g., chage).
# - pwquality cannot reliably enforce "not tied back to the account owner" beyond username checks,
#   and "no dictionary words/acronyms" requires cracklib support (typically configured via PAM).
