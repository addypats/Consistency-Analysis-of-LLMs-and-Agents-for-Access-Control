# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file defines the password quality settings. Note that some requirements –
# such as enforcing a password change every 90 days and preventing reuse for 1 year –
# are typically configured via PAM modules (e.g., pam_unix, pam_pwhistory) and other
# configuration files (e.g., /etc/login.defs), not directly through pwquality.conf.
#
# Enforced password policy rules as configured here:
#
# 1. Minimum password length of 10 characters.
minlen = 10
#
# 2. Require a mix of character types:
#    - At least one lowercase letter.
#    - At least one uppercase letter.
#    - At least one digit.
#    - At least one special character.
#
# In pwquality.conf, negative values for lcredit, ucredit, dcredit, and ocredit
# mean that many characters of each type are required.
lcredit = -1
ucredit = -1
dcredit = -1
ocredit = -1
#
# 3. Enable dictionary checking to avoid common dictionary words or acronyms.
#    (Ensure that the system’s dictionary is appropriately defined.)
dictcheck = 1
#
# 4. Prevent passwords from including the username.
reject_username = 1
#
# 5. Note on additional policies:
#    - "Passwords must not be easily tied back to the account owner" (e.g., using personal information)
#      is enforced by application logic and user education.
#    - The special characters permitted by the system are:
#      !@#$%^&*_+=?/~’;’,<>|\
#
# 6. Password aging (change every 90 days) and history (no reuse within 1 year)
#    must be configured in the appropriate PAM modules or user account policies.
#
# End of file.
