# NOTE: The following policy items are NOT controlled by pwquality.conf and must
# be enforced elsewhere:
# - Passwords must be changed every 90 days -> /etc/login.defs (PASS_MAX_DAYS=90)
#   and/or `chage -M 90 <user>`
# - Passwords cannot be reused for 1 year -> PAM password history (pam_pwhistory
#   or pam_unix remember=...), e.g., remember=12 (monthly changes) or remember=4
#   (quarterly changes) depending on your change frequency
# - Ensuring passwords are not tied to personal info beyond username (SSN, DOB,
#   relatives' names, etc.) is not fully enforceable via pwquality.conf alone; it
#   typically requires additional controls/training and/or custom checks
