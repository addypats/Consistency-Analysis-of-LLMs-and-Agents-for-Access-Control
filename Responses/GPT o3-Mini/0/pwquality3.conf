# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file configures password quality requirements.
#
# Note:
# - The following items must be handled via other tools or PAM modules:
#   • Password expiration (every 90 days) – configure via chage or /etc/login.defs.
#   • Prohibiting password reuse for 1 year – enforce with pam_pwhistory.
#   • Avoiding personal information (e.g. username, SSN, nickname, relatives’ names, birth dates)
#     – ensure your account management process prevents use of such data in passwords.
