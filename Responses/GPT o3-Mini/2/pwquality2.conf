#
# Password Quality Configuration
#
# The following settings enforce these rules:
# 1. All passwords must be at least 8 characters long.
# 2. Passwords must contain at least one alphabetic character and at least one numeric digit.
# 3. Passwords must not be simple dictionary words.
# 4. Passwords must not contain the user's name or username.
#
# NOTE:
# • Password expiration (every 90 days) and the minimum interval between
#   password changes (once every two days) are not managed by this file.
#   They should be configured in system password aging files (e.g., /etc/shadow,
#   /etc/login.defs, or via chage) and enforced through overall system security policy.
# • The prohibition on transmitting passwords via email or storing them unencrypted
#   is a policy matter and must be enforced by user practice and additional controls.
