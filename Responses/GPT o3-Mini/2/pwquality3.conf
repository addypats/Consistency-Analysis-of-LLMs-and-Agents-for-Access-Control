# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file defines settings for password quality enforcement. Note that some of the
# security requirements (such as mandatory password change every 90 days and allowing
# password changes only once every two days) must be configured in other files (for
# example, /etc/login.defs, PAM modules, or your system’s password management policies).
#
# General policy reminders (not enforced by this file):
# • Do not include passwords in email messages or other unencrypted electronic communications.
# • Do not write passwords down or store them electronically without proper encryption.
#
# Password complexity requirements:
# • Minimum password length: 8 characters.
# • Must include at least one numeric character.
# • Must include alphabetic characters (the combination of character classes is enforced).
# • Passwords must not be based on dictionary words.
# • The password must not contain your user name or parts of your full name.
#

minlen = 8

reject_username = 1 # Disallow passwords that contain the user name.
dictcheck = 1       # Check against a dictionary of common words.
