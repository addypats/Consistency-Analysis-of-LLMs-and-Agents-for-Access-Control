# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
# The following comments describe overall password policies.
# NOTE: Some policies (such as password aging and frequency of changes)
# are managed in other system configuration files (e.g., /etc/login.defs or PAM modules).
#
# Policy guidelines:
# 1. Passwords must be changed at least every 90 days.
# 2. Passwords must not be inserted into email or other electronic communications or shared in any form.
# 3. Passwords should not be written down or stored electronically without encryption.
# 4. Passwords must be at least 8 characters long, contain at least one alphabetical character and one numeric digit,
#    must not be based on a dictionary word, and must not be part of your name or username.
# 5. You can only change your password once every two days.
#
# The settings below apply to the quality checking of passwords.

minlen = 8
dcredit = -1        # Require at least one numeric digit.
lcredit = -1        # Require at least one lowercase letter.
                     # (To enforce an alphabetic letter, at least one lowercase or uppercase is needed.
                     #  Here we require one lowercase; if uppercase is desired instead, consider setting ucredit = -1.)
reject_username = 1 # Do not allow passwords that contain the username.
dictcheck = 1       # Check against a dictionary of words.
