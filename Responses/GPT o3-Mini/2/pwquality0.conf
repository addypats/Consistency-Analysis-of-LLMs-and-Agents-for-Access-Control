# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file implements part of our overall password policies.
#
# NOTE: The following policies are managed elsewhere and are not enforced by this file:
# - Passwords must be changed at least every 90 days.
# - Passwords must not be sent via email or other electronic communications.
# - Passwords should not be written down or stored electronically without encryption.
# - Password changes can only occur once every two days.
#
# The settings in this file enforce these password quality rules:
#
# 1. All passwords must be at least 8 characters long.
minlen = 8
#
# 2. Each password must contain at least one numeric character.
dcredit = -1
#
# 3. Each password must contain characters from at least two different classes
#    (for example, alphabetic and numeric). This helps ensure there is at least one
#    alphabetic character (since one of the required classes is numeric as above).
minclass = 2
#
# 4. Passwords must not be based on dictionary words.
dictcheck = 1
