# Configuration for password quality enforcement
# Note: Not all of the following policy rules can be enforced via this file.
# Policies regarding password expiration, change frequency, and secure communication/storage
# must be managed via other mechanisms (e.g., PAM settings, system policies, and training).

# Minimum acceptable size for a new password (8 characters)
minlen = 8

# Require at least one digit in the password
# A negative value for dcredit means that many digits are required.
dcredit = -1

# Ensure that at least two different character classes are used.
# Valid classes include upper-case, lower-case, digits, and others.
minclass = 2

# Enable dictionary word check so that passwords based on dictionary words are rejected.
dictcheck = 1

# Reject passwords that contain the username or parts of the userâ€™s full name.
reject_username = 1

# The following comments outline other policy requirements:
#   - All passwords (e.g., email, web, computer, etc.) must be changed at least every 90 days.
#   - You can only change your password once every two days.
#   - Passwords must not be inserted into email messages or other forms of electronic communication and should not be shared.
#   - Passwords should not be written down or stored electronically without encryption.
# These rules must be enforced through additional system configurations and user policy management.
