# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file implements our password policy guidelines:
#
#  • Passwords must be at least eight characters long in practice, but
#    a minimum length of 15 characters is strongly recommended.
#  • Easily guessed patterns such as sequential digits or common words
#    (e.g. "password") are flagged via dictionary lookup.
#  • New passwords are screened against lists of known breached/compromised passwords.
#  • Password hints are not used (this isn’t a setting here but is enforced elsewhere).
#  • Complexity (e.g. forcing special characters) is not required;
#    long, memorable passphrases (up to 64 characters) are preferred.
#  • Additional layers (e.g. multi-factor or risk-based authentication) are
#    implemented outside of this module.
#
# Minimum acceptable password length. (Policy recommends at least 15.)
minlen = 15

# Do not require a minimum number of different character classes.
# (This relaxes the old complexity rules that forced special characters.)
minclass = 0

# Enable dictionary checking to catch common words and easily guessed patterns.
# This can help identify sequential numbers and words like "password".
dictcheck = 1
# Specify a dictionary file containing common and compromised passwords.
# (Ensure that this file is maintained and updated with known weak credentials.)
dictpath = /usr/share/dict/pwquality

# Prevent use of excessively repeated characters (e.g. "1111" or "aaaa").
maxrepeat = 0

# Allow long passphrases up to 64 characters in length (following NIST guidance).
maxlen = 64

# Note:
# • Screening against previously compromised passwords should be implemented
#   by integrating additional security tools or modules.
#
# • Multi-factor and risk-based authentication settings must be configured
#   in other components of the authentication system.
#
# • Password hints are not provided to the end-user through system prompts.
