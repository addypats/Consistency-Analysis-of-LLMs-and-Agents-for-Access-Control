# Minimum acceptable size for a new password.
# Although passwords must be at least 8 characters in length, this policy requires
# a minimum length of 15 characters to encourage stronger, longer passphrases.
minlen = 15
#
# Disable strict composition requirements.
# Composition rules for including special characters (and for digits, upper- and lower-case letters)
# are no longer required, as these rules sometimes lead to predictable password patterns.

# Enable dictionary checking.
# This option helps identify weak passwords by screening for obvious security weaknesses such as:
# • Sequential number strings
# • Common words (e.g. "password")
# It also provides a rudimentary defense against passwords that may have been compromised previously,
# assuming relevant breach databases are integrated.
dictcheck = 1
#
# Passphrase encouragement:
# Long passwords are encouraged over complex ones. NIST recommends enabling passphrases
# of up to 64 characters. (Make sure other PAM modules and system settings do not unduly restrict
# the allowed maximum length.)
#
# Note for Administrators:
# • Organizations should not use password hints, as these may inadvertently provide attackers with useful clues.
# • Password-based authentication should be supplemented with multi-factor and risk-based techniques
#   for enhanced security.

# End of pwquality configuration.
