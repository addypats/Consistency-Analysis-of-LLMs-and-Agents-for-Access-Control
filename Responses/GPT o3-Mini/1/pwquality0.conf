# Minimum password length: while passwords must be at least 8 characters,
# we strongly recommend a minimum of 15 characters to enhance security.
minlen = 15

# Enable dictionary checking for obvious weaknesses.
# This attempts to detect common words such as "password" and sequential strings.
# Note: Proper dictionary support requires an appropriate dictionary file.
dictcheck = 1

# Screening against previously compromised passwords is not handled by
# pwquality. It is recommended that additional measures (e.g., integration
# with breach databases) be implemented to reject passwords that are known
# to have been exposed.
# (This policy should be enforced via supplementary tools or scripts.)

# Note: Password hints should not be used as they can expose critical clues to attackers.
# This recommendation must be enforced at the application or authentication service level.

# Special character composition requirements are intentionally not enforced;
# emphasizing long passwords (or passphrases) over complex ones.
# This approach avoids predictable complexity rules and aligns with current guidance.

# NIST recommends support for long passphrases, up to 64 characters.
# Ensure that the system allows passwords of up to 64 characters.
# (This may require corresponding configuration in your authentication services.)

# Multi-factor authentication and risk-based authentication techniques
# should be implemented within your broader security infrastructure
# and are not controlled by this file.
