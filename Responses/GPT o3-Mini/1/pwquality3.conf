#
# Password Policy Configuration
#
# 1. Length Requirements:
#    - Passwords must be a minimum of eight characters.
#    - It is recommended that passwords be at least 15 characters in length.
#      In this configuration, we enforce a minimum length of 15 characters.
minlen = 15
#
# 2. Dictionary Check:
#    - Enable screening of new passwords against dictionary words (e.g., "password")
#      to help prevent obvious security weaknesses such as sequential numbers or common words.
dictcheck = 1
#
# 3. Compromised Passwords:
#    - Although not directly enforced by pwquality, external mechanisms should
#      screen passwords against lists of previously breached passwords.
#
# 4. Composition Rules:
#    - Special character composition rules are not enforced since they often lead
#      to predictable substitutions. All credit values are set to 0.
dcredit = 0
ucredit = 0
lcredit = 0
ocredit = 0
#
# 5. Passphrase Support:
#    - Long passwords (passphrases) are encouraged over overly complex ones.
#      NIST recommends enabling passphrases of up to 64 characters.
#      (Note: The maximum acceptable length is not enforced by pwquality here.)
#
# 6. Additional Considerations:
#    - Organizations should avoid using password hints, as these can inadvertently
#      reveal useful clues to attackers.
#
#    - Password-based authentication should be augmented with multi-factor and
#      risk-based authentication measures. Such controls must be implemented in
#      the overall authentication framework and are not managed via pwquality.
