# Note: Organizations are advised not to use password hints as they can leak useful clues.
# (No specific option exists in pwquality.conf to configure password hints.)

# Composition rules for special characters are no longer enforced.
# The following settings disable additional composition requirements:

# Note: Password-based authentication should be augmented with multi-factor and risk-based
# authentication mechanisms at the system configuration level (this is outside the scope
# of pwquality.conf).
