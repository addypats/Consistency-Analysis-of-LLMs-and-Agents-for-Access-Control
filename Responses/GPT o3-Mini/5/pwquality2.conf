# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file configures password quality settings via libpwquality.
# Note: Several of the overall password lifecycle, account lockout,
# inactivity, MFA, and password history requirements must be enforced
# using additional PAM modules and system configurations.
#
# Enforce a minimum password length of 12 characters.
minlen = 12
#
# Require passwords to contain at least two different character classes.
# In this configuration, we require at least one lowercase letter and one digit.
minclass = 2
#
# Require at least one numeric character.
# Negative values indicate that at least the absolute value must be present.
dcredit = -1
#
# Require at least one lowercase alphabetic character.
lcredit = -1
#
# Additional notes (to be implemented via other mechanisms):
#
# - Vendor-supplied defaults and unnecessary default accounts should be removed.
# - Inactive user accounts should be disabled or removed within 90 days.
# - Account lockout after no more than six (or 10, per alternative rule)
#   invalid logon attempts and a lockout duration of at least 30 minutes.
# - Sessions idle for more than 15 minutes should require re-authentication.
# - Password history (disallow reuse of the last four passwords) and periodic
#   change (at least every 90 days) should be enforced through the appropriate PAM modules.
# - Provision of unique passwords on first use and resets must be handled externally.
# - Encryption of authentication mechanisms (password, biometric, Smart Card, tokens)
#   and enforcement of multi-factor authentication (MFA) is expected to be configured 
#   elsewhere.
