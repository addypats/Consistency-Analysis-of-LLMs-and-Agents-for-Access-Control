# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
# This file configures password quality requirements.
#
# The following high‚Äêlevel password policy rules must be enforced system-wide:
# 1. Always change vendor-supplied defaults (passwords and settings) and remove/disable
#    unnecessary default accounts before installing a system on the network.
#
# 2. Remove or disable inactive user accounts within 90 days.
#
# 3. Limit repeated access attempts by locking out the user ID after not more than six attempts.
#
# 4. Set the lockout duration to a minimum of 30 minutes or until an administrator enables the user ID.
#
# 5. If a session has been idle for more than 15 minutes, require re-authentication to reactivate the session.
#
# 6. Passwords/passphrases must be at least 12 characters in length and contain both numeric
#    and alphabetic characters.
#
# 7. (For systems using less strict policies elsewhere, note that passwords should be a minimum
#    of seven characters; however, here the stricter 12-character requirement is applied.)
#
# 8. Change user passwords at least once every 90 days.
#
# 9. Do not allow the reuse of any of the last four passwords.
#
# 10. For first-time and reset passwords, ensure that each user receives a unique temporary password,
#     which must be changed immediately on first use.
#
# 11. Authenticate user access with at least one encrypted mechanism (e.g., password/passphrase,
#     biometric, Smart Card, or token) and enforce multi-factor authentication for all access.
#
# 12. Limit invalid authentication attempts by locking out the account after not more than 10 attempts,
#     with a lockout duration of at least 30 minutes or until identity is verified.
#
# 13. Change passwords immediately if compromise is suspected.
#
# 14. Do not hardcode passwords in scripts and ensure passwords are periodically updated.
#
# NOTE: Many of these rules (such as account inactivity, lockout mechanisms, password history,
# MFA configuration, session re-authentication, and handling of initial/reset passwords) must be
# implemented through additional system configuration (e.g., PAM modules, cron jobs, and other
# security-related configuration files). The settings below apply only to password quality requirements.
#
# Password quality settings:
minlen = 12
# Enforce a minimum length of 12 characters

minclass = 2
# Require at least 2 different character classes (e.g., alphabetic and numeric)

dcredit = -1
# Require at least one digit (a negative value indicates the minimum number of digits)

# End of /etc/security/pwquality.conf
