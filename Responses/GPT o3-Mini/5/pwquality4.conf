# This file defines the password quality requirements enforced by PAM.
#
# NOTE: The remaining requirements (vendor default changes, account lockout,
# inactivity removal, password history, forced change on first use, MFA, etc.)
# must be implemented through other system and PAM configuration files.
#
# Enforce a minimum password length of 12 characters.
minlen = 12
#
# Require at least one digit.
# A negative value forces the use of at least that many digits.
dcredit = -1
#
# Require at least one lowercase alphabetic character.
# (This forces at least one letter; adjust or add ucredit if uppercase-only letters are acceptable.)
lcredit = -1
