# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file configures password complexity requirements.
#
# NOTE: Several of the listed security policy rules (such as vendor default changes,
# inactive account removals, account lockouts, idle session re-authentication timing,
# password expiration, history enforcement, first‚Äêtime password settings, multi-factor 
# authentication, and password change on compromise) cannot be configured via pwquality.conf.
# They must be implemented via additional PAM modules, system settings, or other security
# mechanisms.
#
# The settings below enforce the password complexity rule that passwords/passphrases
# must have a minimum length of 12 characters and include both numeric and alphabetic characters.
#
# Set the minimum acceptable size for a new password (minimum 12 characters required).
minlen = 12
#
# Enforce at least one digit.
# A negative value (e.g. -1) means at least one digit is required.
dcredit = -1
#
# Enforce at least one uppercase letter.
# A negative value (e.g. -1) means at least one uppercase character is required.
ucredit = -1
#
# Enforce at least one lowercase letter.
# A negative value (e.g. -1) means at least one lowercase character is required.
lcredit = -1
#
# Prevent the usage of the username as part of the password.
reject_username = 1
#
# Additional rules that are referenced in your policy (e.g., password history,
# forced password change on first use or after reset, account inactivity, 
# account lockout limits, and MFA enforcement) must be configured in other 
# security configuration files and PAM modules.
