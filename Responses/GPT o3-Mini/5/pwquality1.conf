# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This configuration is intended to enforce a number of password quality requirements.
# Note: Some of the listed security rules (e.g. vendor defaults, account and session management,
# lockout policies, MFA, and password change frequency) must be implemented in other system
# components (such as PAM, account management scripts, or external security tools) and are not
# controlled by pwquality. The settings below address only the password complexity and reuse rules.
#
# Enforce a minimum password length of 12 characters.
minlen = 12
#
# Require at least one numeric character (a negative value here means that at least one digit is required).
dcredit = -1
#
# Require at least one uppercase letter.
ucredit = -1
#
# Require at least one lowercase letter.
lcredit = -1
#
# Prevent reuse of any of the last four passwords (if the PAM module supports it).
remember = 4
