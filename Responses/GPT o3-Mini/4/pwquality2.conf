# NIST-style memorized secret policy:
# - Min length 8 for user-chosen passwords
# - No composition/complexity requirements (no required classes/credits)
# - Do not restrict character sets (allow spaces/symbols); do not truncate
# - Dictionary/blacklist checks are handled outside pwquality (e.g., pam_pwhistory
#   with password history, pam_faillock for rate limiting, and a breached-password
#   blacklist module/service); pwquality's local dictionary check is disabled here
#   to avoid imposing additional complexity rules beyond the minimum length.
