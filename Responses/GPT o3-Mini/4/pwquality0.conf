# Password policy aligned with NIST SP 800-63B guidance:
# - Enforce minimum length for user-chosen passwords.
# - Avoid composition/complexity rules.
# - Do not truncate; allow long passphrases.
# - Blacklist checking must be implemented outside pwquality (e.g., pam_pwhistory with deny=..., pam_passwdqc, pam_breach, or application-side checks).

# Minimum length for subscriber-chosen memorized secrets

# Permit long passphrases (pwquality enforces this as a maximum input length it considers)

# Do not reject repeated/sequential patterns via pwquality
