# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This configuration enforces the following requirements for subscriber‐chosen
# memorized secrets (passwords):
#
# • They MUST be at least 8 characters in length.
# • Secrets up to 64 characters in length are permitted.
# • No additional composition rules (such as requiring mixtures of different
#   character classes or prohibiting consecutive characters) are imposed.
# • Commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords should be rejected
#   (a blacklist check should be implemented externally or via a dictionary—
#   see the dictpath option below).
# • The password shall not contain the username.
#
# Note: Normalization of Unicode characters (e.g. using NFKC) and processing of
# multiple consecutive spaces are expected to be handled outside of this module.
#
# Minimum acceptable length for a subscriber-chosen secret
minlen = 8

# Allow up to 64 characters (the verifier SHOULD permit secrets this long).
# Note: If your system imposes a maximum input length, ensure it supports at least 64.
# (maxlen is not enforced by pam_pwquality, so this is a documentation note only)

# Disable additional character class requirements; no extra credit is demanded
# for lowercase, uppercase, digits, or other characters.
lcredit = 0
ucredit = 0
dcredit = 0
ocredit = 0

# Do not allow the secret to contain the username.
reject_username = 1

# Do not impose any limits on repeated characters.
maxrepeat = 0

# (Optional) Specify a dictionary file containing compromised or commonly-used
# passwords. If the user's chosen secret is found in this list, the password
# change will be rejected and the user prompted to select a different value.
# Uncomment and set the following line to activate this check.
# dictpath = /etc/security/pwquality.dict

# (Optional) Indicate the preferred Unicode normalization form.
# This is advisory; normalization (e.g., using NFKC) should be applied before hashing.
# normalize = NFKC
