# Enable dictionary checking to reject passwords that appear in lists of
# commonly-used, expected, or compromised values (e.g., breached passwords,
# dictionary words, sequential or repetitive character strings, context-specific
# words such as the username or service name, etc.).

# Note:
# - Passwords up to 64 characters SHOULD be accepted.
# - All printing ASCII and Unicode characters are allowed.
# - Administrators should ensure that the system’s password dictionary (as used
#   by cracklib or an equivalent) is updated with values from compromised corpuses.
#
# Additional measures—such as Unicode normalization (using NFKC or NFKD), collapsing
# of multiple spaces, prevention of password hints, and rate-limiting login attempts—
# must be implemented elsewhere in the authentication and account management stack.
