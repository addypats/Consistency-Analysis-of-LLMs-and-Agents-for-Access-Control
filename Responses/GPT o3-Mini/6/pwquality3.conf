# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file contains password quality settings. Note that several of the
# policies referenced below must be implemented via additional PAM modules,
# system account management tools, or MFA configuration outside of pwquality.
#
# 2.1 Use MFA wherever possible.
#     → Ensure that MFA is enabled in your PAM or remote access configuration.
#
# 5.1.1 Password Length Requirements:
#     - For password‐only accounts, require a minimum length of 14 characters.
#     - For MFA‐enabled accounts, a minimum length of 8 characters is acceptable.
#       (Implement the MFA lower-bound requirement in the appropriate MFA configuration.)
#
# The setting below enforces the higher minimum length (14 characters) for
# password-only accounts.
minlen = 14
#
# Note: Maximum password length is not limited by this configuration;
# system constraints will apply.
#
# 5.1.2 Character Type Requirements:
#     Allow all character types but require at least one non‐alphabetic character for
#     password‐only accounts. While this file cannot check “either‐or” (digit or symbol)
#     directly, the following settings require that passwords include at least two character classes.
#
minclass = 2
#
# Alternatively, if you wish to specifically force inclusion of a digit (a non‐alphabetic character),
# you could require at least one digit by setting:
# dcredit = -1
# However, note that this forces a digit even if a special character would otherwise suffice.
#
# 5.1.3 Password Expiration:
#     In the event of a breach, users should be forced to change their passwords immediately,
#     with an annual expiration as a backstop.
#     → Configure expiry policies (e.g., via /etc/login.defs, chage, or directory services)
#        outside of this file.
#
# 5.1.4 Deny List and Change Interval:
#     New passwords must be checked against an internal deny list of known bad/weak
#     passwords (minimum 20 common passwords) and against the previous 5 passwords.
#     Additionally, enforce a delay of at least one day between password changes.
#     → Implement these checks using pam_pwhistory and a custom deny list file.
#
# 5.1.5 Session Inactivity Lock:
#     Lock the current session after 15 minutes (or less) of inactivity.
#     → Configure your session or screensaver settings appropriately.
#
# 5.1.6 Account Lockout and Throttling:
#     - Temporarily lock an account (for 15 minutes or more) after five consecutive failed attempts.
#     - Use time-doubling throttling (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, … minutes between retries), with a permanent
#       lockout (requiring IT reset) after 12 retries.
#     → Enforce these settings via PAM modules like pam_faillock.
#
# 5.1.7 Alerts on Failed Logins:
#     Monitor and alert key personnel when failed login attempts reach the defined threshold.
#     → This is typically configured via your system’s monitoring and alerting framework.
#
# 5.1.8 Account Suspension:
#     Automatically suspend an account after 45 days without a valid login.
#     → Configure this within your account management policy or directory services.
#
# 5.1.9 Disallow Password Hints:
#     Do not allow user-defined password “hints” at login.
#     → Ensure your login and authentication interfaces are not configured to display such hints.
#
# Additional pwquality settings:
#
# Enable dictionary check for new passwords against common passwords.
dictcheck = 1
