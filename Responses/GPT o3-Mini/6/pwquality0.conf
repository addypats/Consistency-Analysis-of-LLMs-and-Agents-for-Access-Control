# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This file configures libpwquality’s password requirements.
# Note: Several of the requested policy rules (e.g., MFA‐account differences,
# password aging, history enforcement, login lockouts, inactivity lock, throttling,
# alerting, and suspension) are enforced via PAM modules or other system settings.
# The options below address only those rules that can be managed via pwquality.
#
# Rule 1 & 2 – Minimum Password Length:
# For password‐only accounts, a minimum length of 14 is required.
# For MFA-enabled accounts a minimum of 8 should be allowed.
# As a single policy controls all users here, we default to the stricter requirement.
minlen = 14
#
# Rule 3 – Maximum Password Length:
# Do not limit the maximum length (system constraints apply).
# (No explicit option is set to limit the maximum password length.)
#
# Rule 4 – Character Requirements:
# Allow all character types, but require at least one non‐alphabetic character
# for password-only accounts. The “ocredit” setting requires (by its negative value)
# at least one character that is not an uppercase or lowercase letter.
ocredit = -1
#
# Rule 5 – Password Expiration Management:
# Immediate password changes on breach and an annual expiration are managed externally,
# for example, via PAM modules (e.g. pam_unix) and the account aging settings.
#
# Rule 6 – Deny List and Password History:
# Enable dictionary (bad password) checking. Configure the path to an internal deny list
# of common or weak passwords (this file should contain at least 20 entries).
dictcheck = 1
dictpath = /usr/share/dict/cracklib/pw_dict
#
# Note: Enforcement of checking against the previous five passwords is handled
# via PAM's password history module (pam_pwhistory) in your PAM configuration.
#
# Rules 7–9 – Additional Password and Session Policies:
# The enforcement of a minimum password change delay (one day), automatic
# session lock after 15 minutes of inactivity, temporary account lockout after
# five failed attempts (with time-doubling throttling and permanent lock after 12 retries),
# monitoring for excessive login failures, suspension after 45 days of inactivity,
# and disallowing user-defined password hints are not managed by pwquality.
# These policies must be implemented by appropriate PAM modules, systemd settings,
# and other security mechanisms.
#
# End of pwquality configuration.
