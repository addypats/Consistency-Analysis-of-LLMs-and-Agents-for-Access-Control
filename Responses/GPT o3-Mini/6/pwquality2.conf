# /etc/security/pwquality.conf
#
# This configuration file enforces password quality settings.
# Note: Several of the policy requirements (MFA, password aging,
# account lockout, session inactivity, historical password checks,
# and administrative alerts) must be implemented via PAM modules,
# system account policies, or external monitoring tools.
#
# 2.1 Use MFA wherever possible.
#     (Configuration for MFA must be applied in the authentication stack.)
#
# 5.1.1 Minimum and Maximum Length Requirements:
#     - For password‐only accounts, a minimum length of 14 characters is required.
#     - For MFA-enabled accounts, a minimum length of 8 characters is acceptable.
#       (This divergence must be handled outside of this file, e.g., by assigning
#        different PAM profiles to different account types.)
#     - No explicit maximum is set (passwords may be as long as system constraints allow).
minlen = 14
# (For MFA-enabled accounts, override this value to 8 in the appropriate PAM configuration.)
#
# 5.1.2 Character Requirements:
#     - All character types are allowed.
#     - For password‐only accounts, at least one character that is not alphabetic is required.
#       Note: pwquality cannot conditionally require non‐alphabetic characters based on account type.
#       The following setting requires at least one digit. Administrators may additionally
#       enforce special (non‐alphanumeric) characters via other controls if desired.
dcredit = -1
#
# 5.1.3 Password Expiration:
#     - In the event of a breach, the password must be changed immediately,
#       with an annual expiration acting as a backstop.
#       (This policy is enforced via system password aging tools such as chage and is not handled here.)
#
# 5.1.4 Deny Lists and Change Delay:
#     - New passwords are checked against an internal deny list of known bad and weak
#       passwords (including a list of at least 20 common passwords) as well as the last 5 passwords.
#       (Exact management of these lists and history checks is implemented via PAM modules
#        such as pam_pwhistory and custom dictionary checks.)
dictcheck = 1
# (Ensure that the deny list file used by your password-history mechanism includes 20+ common passwords.)
#
#     - Enforce a password change delay of at least one day. (This must be configured in the PAM account module.)
#
# 5.1.5 Session Inactivity:
#     - Lock the current session after 15 minutes (or less) of inactivity.
#       (Session timeouts are typically configured in the desktop environment or system session settings.)
#
# 5.1.6 Account Lockout and Throttling:
#     - Temporarily lock an account (15 minutes or more) after five consecutive failed login attempts.
#     - Implement time-doubling throttling between retries (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, etc. minutes)
#       and enforce a permanent lockout (requiring IT reset) after 12 retries.
#       (These settings are handled via PAM modules such as pam_faillock and are not managed here.)
#
# 5.1.7 Alerting:
#     - Monitor and alert key personnel when the failed login attempts reach the defined limit.
#       (Alerting must be implemented using centralized logging and monitoring systems.)
#
# 5.1.8 Account Suspension:
#     - Automatically suspend accounts after 45 days without a successful login.
#       (This policy is managed by external account management tools.)
#
# 5.1.9 Password Hints:
#     - Do not allow user-defined password hints at login.
#       (This is controlled in the user interface and login manager configurations.)
