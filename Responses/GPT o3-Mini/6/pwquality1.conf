# This file controls password quality settings. Note that many of the
# additional security rules (MFA, password expiration, history, account
# lockout, session inactivity locking, alerts, etc.) must be enforced via
# PAM modules and other system configuration files.
#
# Policy summary:
#
# 1. Use MFA wherever possible. (MFA configuration is handled outside this file.)
#
# 2. For password‐only accounts, enforce a minimum length of 14 characters.
#    For MFA‐enabled accounts, a minimum of 8 characters is acceptable.
#    (Adjust via PAM configuration for MFA-enabled accounts as needed.)
#
# 3. No maximum password length is imposed (limited only by system constraints).
#
# 4. All character types are permitted, but for password‐only accounts at
#    least one non‐alphabetic character must be used.
#
# 5. In the event of a breach, force an immediate password change with an
#    annual expiration backstop.
#
# 6. New passwords are checked against an internal deny list (of at least 20
#    common or weak passwords) and the previous 5 passwords. (Enforced via
#    PAM modules such as pam_pwhistory and external deny list files.)
#
# 7. Enforce a minimum delay of one day between password changes.
#
# 8. Lock the current session after 15 minutes (or less) of inactivity.
#
# 9. Implement temporary account lockout (minimum 15 minutes) after five
#    consecutive failed login attempts with time-doubling throttling (0, 1, 2,
#    4, 8, etc. minutes) and a permanent lock after 12 retries (IT reset required).
#
# 10. Monitor and alert key personnel when failed login attempts reach the limit.
#
# 11. Automatically suspend an account after 45 days without a valid login.
#
# 12. Do not allow user-defined password hints at login.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# pwquality settings below (others must be set in corresponding PAM and
# system configuration files):

# Enforce a minimum length of 14 characters for password-only accounts.
minlen = 14

# Note: For MFA-enabled accounts, a minimum effective length of 8 may be set
# in the appropriate PAM configuration overriding this value.

# Require at least two character classes (e.g., uppercase, lowercase, digits,
# or special characters). This forces password-only accounts to include at least
# one non-alphabetic character.
minclass = 2

# Enable dictionary checks against a list of common or weak passwords.
dictcheck = 1
# (Optional: specify the deny list file path if available)
# badwords = /etc/security/bad_passwords.txt

# No maximum length limit is specified here; the system’s constraints apply.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# IMPORTANT: The following policies must be implemented via additional PAM
# modules or system settings.
#
# - Password change triggers after a breach and annual expiration.
# - Preventing password reuse (previous 5 passwords) and enforcing a minimum
#   delay between changes (at least one day).
# - Session lock (15 minutes inactivity) and account lockout parameters including
#   temporary lockouts with time doubling and permanent lockout after 12 retries.
# - Monitoring/alerting on failed login attempts.
# - Automatic account suspension after 45 days of inactivity.
# - Disabling user-defined password hints.
#
# Please ensure that your PAM configuration (e.g., pam_pwquality, pam_faillock,
# pam_unix, pam_pwhistory) and other security tools are configured accordingly.
