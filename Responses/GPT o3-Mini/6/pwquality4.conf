# /etc/security/pwquality.conf

# Rule 2.1: Use MFA wherever possible.
#   Note: MFA requirements are enforced via PAM and other system modules, not via this file.

# Rule 5.1.1: Password length requirements.
#   For password‐only accounts, a minimum length of 14 characters is required.
#   For accounts with MFA enabled, a minimum length of 8 characters may be allowed;
#   adjust the PAM configuration accordingly. Here the default stricter (password‐only)
#   policy is specified.
minlen = 14

# Rule 5.1.1: Maximum password length.
#   No maximum length is enforced here so that passwords can be as long as system constraints allow.

# Rule 5.1.2: Character composition.
#   Allow all character types, but require at least one non‐alphabetic character.
#   Since pwquality cannot enforce an “OR” condition (digit or symbol only),
#   both a digit and a punctuation (non-alphabetic) are required.
dcredit = -1
ocredit = -1
# ucredit and lcredit are left at 0 to permit flexibility in the choice of alphabetic characters.
minclass = 2

# Rule 5.1.3: Password expiration.
#   In the event of a breach, require an immediate password change,
#   with an annual expiration as a backstop.
#   This behavior must be implemented via external PAM modules and system cron/job policies.

# Rule 5.1.4: Deny lists and password history.
#   New passwords are checked against an internal deny list (of at least 20 common weak passwords)
#   and the previous 5 passwords. Additionally, enforce a minimum delay of one day between password changes.
#   These controls are configured in other authentication modules (for example, pam_pwhistory).

# Rule 5.1.5: Session inactivity lock.
#   Automatically lock the current session after 15 minutes (or less) of inactivity.
#   This control is managed by the system’s session management/screen locker settings.

# Rule 5.1.6: Failed login handling.
#   Temporary account lockout for 15 minutes (or longer) following five consecutive failed attempts,
#   with time-doubling throttling (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, … minutes) between each retry,
#   and a permanent lockout after 12 retries (IT reset required).
#   These rules are managed via external modules such as pam_faillock.

# Rule 5.1.7: Alerting on repeated failures.
#   Monitor and alert key personnel when failed login attempts reach the defined threshold.
#   This functionality should be implemented in the system monitoring/alerting infrastructure.

# Rule 5.1.8: Account suspension.
#   Automatically suspend accounts after 45 days without a valid login.
#   This is handled by account management policies external to this file.

# Rule 5.1.9: Password hints.
#   Disallow user-defined password hints at login.
#   This is enforced by the authentication interface, not via this file.
